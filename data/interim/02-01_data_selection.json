            "text": "This letter is from Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, chosen by God to be an apostle and sent out to preach his Good News. God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures. The Good News is about his Son. In his earthly life he was born into King David\u2019s family line, and he was shown to be the Son of God when he was raised from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit. He is Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, God has given us the privilege and authority as apostles to tell Gentiles everywhere what God has done for them, so that they will believe and obey him, bringing glory to his name. And you are included among those Gentiles who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ. I am writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. Let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world. God knows how often I pray for you. Day and night I bring you and your needs in prayer to God, whom I serve with all my heart by spreading the Good News about his Son. One of the things I always pray for is the opportunity, God willing, to come at last to see you. For I long to visit you so I can bring you some spiritual gift that will help you grow strong in the Lord. When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours. I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to visit you, but I was prevented until now. I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit, just as I have seen among other Gentiles. For I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world, to the educated and uneducated alike. So I am eager to come to you in Rome, too, to preach the Good News. For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes\u2014the Jew first and also the Gentile. This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, \u201cIt is through faith that a righteous person has life.\u201d But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness. They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities\u2014his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God. Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn\u2019t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools. And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles. So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other\u2019s bodies. They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved. Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done. Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy. They know God\u2019s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too. \n\nYou may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse! When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself, for you who judge others do these very same things. And we know that God, in his justice, will punish anyone who does such things. Since you judge others for doing these things, why do you think you can avoid God\u2019s judgment when you do the same things? Don\u2019t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can\u2019t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin? But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself. For a day of anger is coming, when God\u2019s righteous judgment will be revealed. He will judge everyone according to what they have done. He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good, seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers. But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness. There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil\u2014for the Jew first and also for the Gentile. But there will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who do good\u2014for the Jew first and also for the Gentile. For God does not show favoritism. When the Gentiles sin, they will be destroyed, even though they never had God\u2019s written law. And the Jews, who do have God\u2019s law, will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it. For merely listening to the law doesn\u2019t make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight. Even Gentiles, who do not have God\u2019s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. They demonstrate that God\u2019s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right. And this is the message I proclaim\u2014that the day is coming when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge everyone\u2019s secret life. You who call yourselves Jews are relying on God\u2019s law, and you boast about your special relationship with him. You know what he wants; you know what is right because you have been taught his law. You are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness. You think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God. For you are certain that God\u2019s law gives you complete knowledge and truth. Well then, if you teach others, why don\u2019t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples? You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it. No wonder the Scriptures say, \u201cThe Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.\u201d The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God\u2019s law. But if you don\u2019t obey God\u2019s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile. And if the Gentiles obey God\u2019s law, won\u2019t God declare them to be his own people? In fact, uncircumcised Gentiles who keep God\u2019s law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God\u2019s law but don\u2019t obey it. For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision. No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by the Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people. \n\nThen what\u2019s the advantage of being a Jew? Is there any value in the ceremony of circumcision? Yes, there are great benefits! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God. True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they were unfaithful, does that mean God will be unfaithful? Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him, \u201cYou will be proved right in what you say, and you will win your case in court.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d some might say, \u201cour sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn\u2019t it unfair, then, for him to punish us?\u201d (This is merely a human point of view.) Of course not! If God were not entirely fair, how would he be qualified to judge the world? \u201cBut,\u201d someone might still argue, \u201chow can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory?\u201d And some people even slander us by claiming that we say, \u201cThe more we sin, the better it is!\u201d Those who say such things deserve to be condemned. Well then, should we conclude that we Jews are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether Jews or Gentiles, are under the power of sin. As the Scriptures say, \u201cNo one is righteous\u2014 not even one. No one is truly wise; no one is seeking God. All have turned away; all have become useless. No one does good, not a single one.\u201d \u201cTheir talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their tongues are filled with lies.\u201d \u201cSnake venom drips from their lips.\u201d \u201cTheir mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.\u201d \u201cThey rush to commit murder. Destruction and misery always follow them. They don\u2019t know where to find peace.\u201d \u201cThey have no fear of God at all.\u201d Obviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given, for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses, and to show that the entire world is guilty before God. For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are. But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago. We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are. For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God\u2019s glorious standard. Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past, for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus. Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith. So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law. After all, is God the God of the Jews only? Isn\u2019t he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is. There is only one God, and he makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles. Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law. \n\nAbraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God? If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God\u2019s way. For the Scriptures tell us, \u201cAbraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.\u201d When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned. But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners. David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it: \u201cOh, what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sins are put out of sight. Yes, what joy for those whose record the Lord has cleared of sin.\u201d Now, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles? Well, we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith. But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised! Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous\u2014even before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are counted as righteous because of their faith. And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised. Clearly, God\u2019s promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God\u2019s law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith. If God\u2019s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless. For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!) So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham\u2019s. For Abraham is the father of all who believe. That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, \u201cI have made you the father of many nations.\u201d This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing. Even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping\u2014believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God had said to him, \u201cThat\u2019s how many descendants you will have!\u201d And Abraham\u2019s faith did not weaken, even though, at about 100 years of age, he figured his body was as good as dead\u2014and so was Sarah\u2019s womb. Abraham never wavered in believing God\u2019s promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God. He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises. And because of Abraham\u2019s faith, God counted him as righteous. And when God counted him as righteous, it wasn\u2019t just for Abraham\u2019s benefit. It was recorded for our benefit, too, assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him, the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God. \n\nTherefore, since we have been made right in God\u2019s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God\u2019s glory. We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love. When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners. Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good. But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. And since we have been made right in God\u2019s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God\u2019s condemnation. For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son. So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God. When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam\u2019s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned. Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break. Still, everyone died\u2014from the time of Adam to the time of Moses\u2014even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. Now Adam is a symbol, a representation of Christ, who was yet to come. But there is a great difference between Adam\u2019s sin and God\u2019s gracious gift. For the sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many. But even greater is God\u2019s wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ. And the result of God\u2019s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man\u2019s sin. For Adam\u2019s sin led to condemnation, but God\u2019s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins. For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God\u2019s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ. Yes, Adam\u2019s one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ\u2019s one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone. Because one person disobeyed God, many became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many will be made righteous. God\u2019s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God\u2019s wonderful grace became more abundant. So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God\u2019s wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n\nWell then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death? For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives. Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was. We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin. For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin. And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him. When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God. So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus. Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires. Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God. Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God\u2019s grace. Well then, since God\u2019s grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not! Don\u2019t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living. Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you. Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living. Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy. When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right. And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom. But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. \n\nNow, dear brothers and sisters\u2014you who are familiar with the law\u2014don\u2019t you know that the law applies only while a person is living? For example, when a woman marries, the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive. But if he dies, the laws of marriage no longer apply to her. So while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery if she married another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries. So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point: You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God. When we were controlled by our old nature, sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds, resulting in death. But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit. Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, \u201cYou must not covet.\u201d But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me! If there were no law, sin would not have that power. At one time I lived without understanding the law. But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life, and I died. So I discovered that the law\u2019s commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead. Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me. But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good. But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my death? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God\u2019s good commands for its own evil purposes. So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin. I don\u2019t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don\u2019t do it. Instead, I do what I hate. But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good. So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it. And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I want to do what is right, but I can\u2019t. I want to do what is good, but I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. But if I do what I don\u2019t want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it. I have discovered this principle of life\u2014that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong. I love God\u2019s law with all my heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me. Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death? Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God\u2019s law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin. \n\nSo now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus. And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death. The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature. So God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin\u2019s control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins. He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit. Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit. So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God\u2019s laws, and it never will. That\u2019s why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God. But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.) And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God. The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you. Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, you have no obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do. For if you live by its dictates, you will die. But if through the power of the Spirit you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God\u2019s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God\u2019s children. And since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God\u2019s glory. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering. Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later. For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are. Against its will, all creation was subjected to God\u2019s curse. But with eager hope, the creation looks forward to the day when it will join God\u2019s children in glorious freedom from death and decay. For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. And we believers also groan, even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering. We, too, wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children, including the new bodies he has promised us. We were given this hope when we were saved. (If we already have something, we don\u2019t need to hope for it. But if we look forward to something we don\u2019t yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.) And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don\u2019t know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words. And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with God\u2019s own will. And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory. What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won\u2019t he also give us everything else? Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one\u2014for God himself has given us right standing with himself. Who then will condemn us? No one\u2014for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at God\u2019s right hand, pleading for us. Can anything ever separate us from Christ\u2019s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? (As the Scriptures say, \u201cFor your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.\u201d) No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us. And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God\u2019s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow\u2014not even the powers of hell can separate us from God\u2019s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below\u2014indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. \n\nWith Christ as my witness, I speak with utter truthfulness. My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it. My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed\u2014cut off from Christ!\u2014if that would save them. They are the people of Israel, chosen to be God\u2019s adopted children. God revealed his glory to them. He made covenants with them and gave them his law. He gave them the privilege of worshiping him and receiving his wonderful promises. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors, and Christ himself was an Israelite as far as his human nature is concerned. And he is God, the one who rules over everything and is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. Well then, has God failed to fulfill his promise to Israel? No, for not all who are born into the nation of Israel are truly members of God\u2019s people! Being descendants of Abraham doesn\u2019t make them truly Abraham\u2019s children. For the Scriptures say, \u201cIsaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted,\u201d though Abraham had other children, too. This means that Abraham\u2019s physical descendants are not necessarily children of God. Only the children of the promise are considered to be Abraham\u2019s children. For God had promised, \u201cI will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d This son was our ancestor Isaac. When he married Rebekah, she gave birth to twins. But before they were born, before they had done anything good or bad, she received a message from God. (This message shows that God chooses people according to his own purposes; he calls people, but not according to their good or bad works.) She was told, \u201cYour older son will serve your younger son.\u201d In the words of the Scriptures, \u201cI loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau.\u201d Are we saying, then, that God was unfair? Of course not! For God said to Moses, \u201cI will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.\u201d So it is God who decides to show mercy. We can neither choose it nor work for it. For the Scriptures say that God told Pharaoh, \u201cI have appointed you for the very purpose of displaying my power in you and to spread my fame throughout the earth.\u201d So you see, God chooses to show mercy to some, and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen. Well then, you might say, \u201cWhy does God blame people for not responding? Haven\u2019t they simply done what he makes them do?\u201d No, don\u2019t say that. Who are you, a mere human being, to argue with God? Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it, \u201cWhy have you made me like this?\u201d When a potter makes jars out of clay, doesn\u2019t he have a right to use the same lump of clay to make one jar for decoration and another to throw garbage into? In the same way, even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction. He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy, who were prepared in advance for glory. And we are among those whom he selected, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles. Concerning the Gentiles, God says in the prophecy of Hosea, \u201cThose who were not my people, I will now call my people. And I will love those whom I did not love before.\u201d And, \u201cThen, at the place where they were told, \u2018You are not my people,\u2019 there they will be called \u2018children of the living God.\u2019\u201d And concerning Israel, Isaiah the prophet cried out, \u201cThough the people of Israel are as numerous as the sand of the seashore, only a remnant will be saved. For the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth quickly and with finality.\u201d And Isaiah said the same thing in another place: \u201cIf the Lord of Heaven\u2019s Armies had not spared a few of our children, we would have been wiped out like Sodom, destroyed like Gomorrah.\u201d What does all this mean? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God\u2019s standards, they were made right with God. And it was by faith that this took place. But the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded. Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path. God warned them of this in the Scriptures when he said, \u201cI am placing a stone in Jerusalem that makes people stumble, a rock that makes them fall. But anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.\u201d \n\nDear brothers and sisters, the longing of my heart and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved. I know what enthusiasm they have for God, but it is misdirected zeal. For they don\u2019t understand God\u2019s way of making people right with himself. Refusing to accept God\u2019s way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law. For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God. For Moses writes that the law\u2019s way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands. But faith\u2019s way of getting right with God says, \u201cDon\u2019t say in your heart, \u2018Who will go up to heaven?\u2019 (to bring Christ down to earth). And don\u2019t say, \u2018Who will go down to the place of the dead?\u2019 (to bring Christ back to life again).\u201d In fact, it says, \u201cThe message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.\u201d And that message is the very message about faith that we preach: If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, \u201cAnyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.\u201d Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him. For \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, \u201cHow beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!\u201d But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, \u201cLord, who has believed our message?\u201d So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ. But I ask, have the people of Israel actually heard the message? Yes, they have: \u201cThe message has gone throughout the earth, and the words to all the world.\u201d But I ask, did the people of Israel really understand? Yes, they did, for even in the time of Moses, God said, \u201cI will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation. I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles.\u201d And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God, saying, \u201cI was found by people who were not looking for me. I showed myself to those who were not asking for me.\u201d But regarding Israel, God said, \u201cAll day long I opened my arms to them, but they were disobedient and rebellious.\u201d \n\nI ask, then, has God rejected his own people, the nation of Israel? Of course not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham and a member of the tribe of Benjamin. No, God has not rejected his own people, whom he chose from the very beginning. Do you realize what the Scriptures say about this? Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said, \u201cLord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.\u201d And do you remember God\u2019s reply? He said, \u201cNo, I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal!\u201d It is the same today, for a few of the people of Israel have remained faithful because of God\u2019s grace\u2014his undeserved kindness in choosing them. And since it is through God\u2019s kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God\u2019s grace would not be what it really is\u2014free and undeserved. So this is the situation: Most of the people of Israel have not found the favor of God they are looking for so earnestly. A few have\u2014the ones God has chosen\u2014but the hearts of the rest were hardened. As the Scriptures say, \u201cGod has put them into a deep sleep. To this day he has shut their eyes so they do not see, and closed their ears so they do not hear.\u201d Likewise, David said, \u201cLet their bountiful table become a snare, a trap that makes them think all is well. Let their blessings cause them to stumble, and let them get what they deserve. Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see, and let their backs be bent forever.\u201d Did God\u2019s people stumble and fall beyond recovery? Of course not! They were disobedient, so God made salvation available to the Gentiles. But he wanted his own people to become jealous and claim it for themselves. Now if the Gentiles were enriched because the people of Israel turned down God\u2019s offer of salvation, think how much greater a blessing the world will share when they finally accept it. I am saying all this especially for you Gentiles. God has appointed me as the apostle to the Gentiles. I stress this, for I want somehow to make the people of Israel jealous of what you Gentiles have, so I might save some of them. For since their rejection meant that God offered salvation to the rest of the world, their acceptance will be even more wonderful. It will be life for those who were dead! And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy\u2014just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy. For if the roots of the tree are holy, the branches will be, too. But some of these branches from Abraham\u2019s tree\u2014some of the people of Israel\u2014have been broken off. And you Gentiles, who were branches from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in. So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God\u2019s special olive tree. But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root. \u201cWell,\u201d you may say, \u201cthose branches were broken off to make room for me.\u201d Yes, but remember\u2014those branches were broken off because they didn\u2019t believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe. So don\u2019t think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen. For if God did not spare the original branches, he won\u2019t spare you either. Notice how God is both kind and severe. He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness. But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off. And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree. You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree. So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong. I want you to understand this mystery, dear brothers and sisters, so that you will not feel proud about yourselves. Some of the people of Israel have hard hearts, but this will last only until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ. And so all Israel will be saved. As the Scriptures say, \u201cThe one who rescues will come from Jerusalem, and he will turn Israel away from ungodliness. And this is my covenant with them, that I will take away their sins.\u201d Many of the people of Israel are now enemies of the Good News, and this benefits you Gentiles. Yet they are still the people he loves because he chose their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For God\u2019s gifts and his call can never be withdrawn. Once, you Gentiles were rebels against God, but when the people of Israel rebelled against him, God was merciful to you instead. Now they are the rebels, and God\u2019s mercy has come to you so that they, too, will share in God\u2019s mercy. For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone. Oh, how great are God\u2019s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways! For who can know the Lord\u2019s thoughts? Who knows enough to give him advice? And who has given him so much that he needs to pay it back? For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen. \n\nAnd so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice\u2014the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him. Don\u2019t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God\u2019s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect. Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning: Don\u2019t think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us. Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, so it is with Christ\u2019s body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other. In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you. If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well. If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly. Don\u2019t just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good. Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other. Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically. Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying. When God\u2019s people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you. Don\u2019t curse them; pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with each other. Don\u2019t be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don\u2019t think you know it all! Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable. Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone. Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, \u201cI will take revenge; I will pay them back,\u201d says the Lord. Instead, \u201cIf your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads.\u201d Don\u2019t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good. \n\nEveryone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished. For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong. Would you like to live without fear of the authorities? Do what is right, and they will honor you. The authorities are God\u2019s servants, sent for your good. But if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid, for they have the power to punish you. They are God\u2019s servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong. So you must submit to them, not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience. Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons. For government workers need to be paid. They are serving God in what they do. Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them, and give respect and honor to those who are in authority. Owe nothing to anyone\u2014except for your obligation to love one another. If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God\u2019s law. For the commandments say, \u201cYou must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not covet.\u201d These\u2014and other such commandments\u2014are summed up in this one commandment: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d Love does no wrong to others, so love fulfills the requirements of God\u2019s law. This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living. Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don\u2019t participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don\u2019t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires. \n\nAccept other believers who are weak in faith, and don\u2019t argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. For instance, one person believes it\u2019s all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables. Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don\u2019t. And those who don\u2019t eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. Who are you to condemn someone else\u2019s servants? Their own master will judge whether they stand or fall. And with the Lord\u2019s help, they will stand and receive his approval. In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable. Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him. Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God. For we don\u2019t live for ourselves or die for ourselves. If we live, it\u2019s to honor the Lord. And if we die, it\u2019s to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. Christ died and rose again for this very purpose\u2014to be Lord both of the living and of the dead. So why do you condemn another believer? Why do you look down on another believer? Remember, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For the Scriptures say, \u201c\u2018As surely as I live,\u2019 says the Lord, \u2018every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will declare allegiance to God.\u2019\u201d Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God. So let\u2019s stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall. I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong. And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don\u2019t let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died. Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good. For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too. So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up. Don\u2019t tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble. You may believe there\u2019s nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don\u2019t feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right. But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning. \n\nWe who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves. We should help others do what is right and build them up in the Lord. For even Christ didn\u2019t live to please himself. As the Scriptures say, \u201cThe insults of those who insult you, O God, have fallen on me.\u201d Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God\u2019s promises to be fulfilled. May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus. Then all of you can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory. Remember that Christ came as a servant to the Jews to show that God is true to the promises he made to their ancestors. He also came so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercies to them. That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote: \u201cFor this, I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing praises to your name.\u201d And in another place it is written, \u201cRejoice with his people, you Gentiles.\u201d And yet again, \u201cPraise the Lord, all you Gentiles. Praise him, all you people of the earth.\u201d And in another place Isaiah said, \u201cThe heir to David\u2019s throne will come, and he will rule over the Gentiles. They will place their hope on him.\u201d I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit. I am fully convinced, my dear brothers and sisters, that you are full of goodness. You know these things so well you can teach each other all about them. Even so, I have been bold enough to write about some of these points, knowing that all you need is this reminder. For by God\u2019s grace, I am a special messenger from Christ Jesus to you Gentiles. I bring you the Good News so that I might present you as an acceptable offering to God, made holy by the Holy Spirit. So I have reason to be enthusiastic about all Christ Jesus has done through me in my service to God. Yet I dare not boast about anything except what Christ has done through me, bringing the Gentiles to God by my message and by the way I worked among them. They were convinced by the power of miraculous signs and wonders and by the power of God\u2019s Spirit. In this way, I have fully presented the Good News of Christ from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum. My ambition has always been to preach the Good News where the name of Christ has never been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else. I have been following the plan spoken of in the Scriptures, where it says, \u201cThose who have never been told about him will see, and those who have never heard of him will understand.\u201d In fact, my visit to you has been delayed so long because I have been preaching in these places. But now I have finished my work in these regions, and after all these long years of waiting, I am eager to visit you. I am planning to go to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off in Rome. And after I have enjoyed your fellowship for a little while, you can provide for my journey. But before I come, I must go to Jerusalem to take a gift to the believers there. For you see, the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have eagerly taken up an offering for the poor among the believers in Jerusalem. They were glad to do this because they feel they owe a real debt to them. Since the Gentiles received the spiritual blessings of the Good News from the believers in Jerusalem, they feel the least they can do in return is to help them financially. As soon as I have delivered this money and completed this good deed of theirs, I will come to see you on my way to Spain. And I am sure that when I come, Christ will richly bless our time together. Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to join in my struggle by praying to God for me. Do this because of your love for me, given to you by the Holy Spirit. Pray that I will be rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God. Pray also that the believers there will be willing to accept the donation I am taking to Jerusalem. Then, by the will of God, I will be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and we will be an encouragement to each other. And now may God, who gives us his peace, be with you all. Amen. \n\nI commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deacon in the church in Cenchrea. Welcome her in the Lord as one who is worthy of honor among God\u2019s people. Help her in whatever she needs, for she has been helpful to many, and especially to me. Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in the ministry of Christ Jesus. In fact, they once risked their lives for me. I am thankful to them, and so are all the Gentile churches. Also give my greetings to the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epenetus. He was the first person from the province of Asia to become a follower of Christ. Give my greetings to Mary, who has worked so hard for your benefit. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews, who were in prison with me. They are highly respected among the apostles and became followers of Christ before I did. Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. Greet Apelles, a good man whom Christ approves. And give my greetings to the believers from the household of Aristobulus. Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet the Lord\u2019s people from the household of Narcissus. Give my greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa, the Lord\u2019s workers, and to dear Persis, who has worked so hard for the Lord. Greet Rufus, whom the Lord picked out to be his very own; and also his dear mother, who has been a mother to me. Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters who meet with them. Give my greetings to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and to Olympas and all the believers who meet with them. Greet each other with a sacred kiss. All the churches of Christ send you their greetings. And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people\u2019s faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them. Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people. But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord. This makes me very happy. I want you to be wise in doing right and to stay innocent of any wrong. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews. I, Tertius, the one writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings, too, as one of the Lord\u2019s followers. Gaius says hello to you. He is my host and also serves as host to the whole church. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends you his greetings, and so does our brother Quartus.  Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time. But now as the prophets foretold and as the eternal God has commanded, this message is made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they too might believe and obey him. All glory to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, forever. Amen. \n\n",

                "So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.",
                "As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other\u2019s bodies.",
                "They traded the truth about God for a lie.",

                "But how did this happen?",
                "Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised?",
                "Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised!",
                "Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous\u2014even before he was circumcised.",

                "Clearly, God\u2019s promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God\u2019s law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith.",
                "If God\u2019s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless.",

                "He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises.",
                "And because of Abraham\u2019s faith, God counted him as righteous.",

                "And this hope will not lead to disappointment.",

                "When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.",
                "Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good.",
                "But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.",
                "And since we have been made right in God\u2019s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God\u2019s condemnation.",

                "But even greater is God\u2019s wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ.",
                "And the result of God\u2019s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man\u2019s sin.",
                "For Adam\u2019s sin led to condemnation, but God\u2019s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins.",

                "God\u2019s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were.",
                "But as people sinned more and more, God\u2019s wonderful grace became more abundant.",

                "Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was.",
                "We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives.",
                "We are no longer slaves to sin.",
                "For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin.",
                "And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him.",
                "We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again.",
                "Death no longer has any power over him.",
                "When he died, he died once to break the power of sin.",
                "But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God.",
                "So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.",
                "Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires.",
                "Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin.",
                "Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life.",
                "So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God.",
                "Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law.",
                "Instead, you live under the freedom of God\u2019s grace.",
                "Well then, since God\u2019s grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning?",
                "Of course not!",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey?",
                "You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living.",
                "Thank God!",
                "Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you.",
                "Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living.",
                "Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this.",
                "Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin.",
                "Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.",
                "When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right.",
                "And what was the result?",
                "You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom.",
                "But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God.",
                "Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life.",
                "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. \n\n",
                "Now, dear brothers and sisters\u2014you who are familiar with the law\u2014don\u2019t you know that the law applies only while a person is living?",
                "For example, when a woman marries, the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive.",
                "But if he dies, the laws of marriage no longer apply to her.",
                "So while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery if she married another man.",
                "But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries.",
                "So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point: You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ.",
                "And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead.",
                "As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God.",
                "When we were controlled by our old nature, sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds, resulting in death.",
                "But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power.",
                "Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit.",
                "Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful?",
                "Of course not!",
                "In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin.",
                "I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, \u201cYou must not covet.\u201d",
                "But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me!",
                "If there were no law, sin would not have that power.",
                "At one time I lived without understanding the law.",
                "But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life, and I died.",
                "So I discovered that the law\u2019s commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead.",
                "Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me.",
                "But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good.",
                "But how can that be?",
                "Did the law, which is good, cause my death?",
                "Of course not!",
                "Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death.",
                "So we can see how terrible sin really is.",
                "It uses God\u2019s good commands for its own evil purposes.",
                "So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good.",
                "The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin.",
                "I don\u2019t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don\u2019t do it.",
                "Instead, I do what I hate.",
                "But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good.",
                "So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.",
                "And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.",
                "I want to do what is right, but I can\u2019t.",
                "I want to do what is good, but I don\u2019t.",
                "I don\u2019t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway.",
                "But if I do what I don\u2019t want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.",
                "I have discovered this principle of life\u2014that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.",
                "I love God\u2019s law with all my heart.",
                "But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind.",
                "This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me.",
                "Oh, what a miserable person I am!",
                "Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?",
                "Thank God!",
                "The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord.",
                "So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God\u2019s law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin. \n\n",
                "So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.",
                "And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death.",
                "The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature.",
                "So God did what the law could not do.",
                "He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have.",
                "And in that body God declared an end to sin\u2019s control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.",
                "He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.",
                "Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.",
                "So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death.",
                "But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace.",
                "For the sinful nature is always hostile to God.",
                "It never did obey God\u2019s laws, and it never will.",
                "That\u2019s why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.",
                "But you are not controlled by your sinful nature.",
                "You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you.",
                "(And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.)",
                "And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God.",
                "The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you.",
                "And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you.",
                "Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, you have no obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do.",
                "For if you live by its dictates, you will die.",
                "But if through the power of the Spirit you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature, you will live.",
                "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.",
                "So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves.",
                "Instead, you received God\u2019s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children.",
                "Now we call him, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d",
                "For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God\u2019s children.",
                "And since we are his children, we are his heirs.",
                "In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God\u2019s glory.",
                "But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering.",
                "Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later.",
                "For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are.",
                "Against its will, all creation was subjected to God\u2019s curse.",
                "But with eager hope, the creation looks forward to the day when it will join God\u2019s children in glorious freedom from death and decay.",
                "For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.",
                "And we believers also groan, even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering.",
                "We, too, wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children, including the new bodies he has promised us.",
                "We were given this hope when we were saved.",
                "(If we already have something, we don\u2019t need to hope for it.",
                "But if we look forward to something we don\u2019t yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.)",
                "And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness.",
                "For example, we don\u2019t know what God wants us to pray for.",
                "But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words.",
                "And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with God\u2019s own will.",
                "And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.",
                "For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.",
                "And having chosen them, he called them to come to him.",
                "And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself.",
                "And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory.",
                "What shall we say about such wonderful things as these?",
                "If God is for us, who can ever be against us?",
                "Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won\u2019t he also give us everything else?",
                "Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own?",
                "No one\u2014for God himself has given us right standing with himself.",
                "Who then will condemn us?",
                "No one\u2014for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at God\u2019s right hand, pleading for us.",
                "Can anything ever separate us from Christ\u2019s love?",
                "Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death?",
                "(As the Scriptures say, \u201cFor your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.\u201d)",
                "No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.",

                "Haven\u2019t they simply done what he makes them do?\u201d",

                "In fact, it says, \u201cThe message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.\u201d",
                "And that message is the very message about faith that we preach: If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.",
                "For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved.",
                "As the Scriptures tell us, \u201cAnyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.\u201d",
                "Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect.",
                "They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him.",
                "For \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d",
                "But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him?",
                "And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him?",
                "And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them?",
                "And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent?",
                "That is why the Scriptures say, \u201cHow beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!\u201d",
                "But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, \u201cLord, who has believed our message?\u201d",
                "So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.",
                "But I ask, have the people of Israel actually heard the message?",
                "Yes, they have: \u201cThe message has gone throughout the earth, and the words to all the world.\u201d",
                "But I ask, did the people of Israel really understand?",
                "Yes, they did, for even in the time of Moses, God said, \u201cI will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation.",
                "I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles.\u201d",
                "And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God, saying, \u201cI was found by people who were not looking for me.",
                "I showed myself to those who were not asking for me.\u201d",
                "But regarding Israel, God said, \u201cAll day long I opened my arms to them, but they were disobedient and rebellious.\u201d \n\n",
                "I ask, then, has God rejected his own people, the nation of Israel?",
                "Of course not!",
                "I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham and a member of the tribe of Benjamin.",
                "No, God has not rejected his own people, whom he chose from the very beginning.",
                "Do you realize what the Scriptures say about this?",
                "Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said, \u201cLord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars.",
                "I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.\u201d",
                "And do you remember God\u2019s reply?",
                "He said, \u201cNo, I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal!\u201d",
                "It is the same today, for a few of the people of Israel have remained faithful because of God\u2019s grace\u2014his undeserved kindness in choosing them.",
                "And since it is through God\u2019s kindness, then it is not by their good works.",
                "For in that case, God\u2019s grace would not be what it really is\u2014free and undeserved.",
                "So this is the situation: Most of the people of Israel have not found the favor of God they are looking for so earnestly.",
                "A few have\u2014the ones God has chosen\u2014but the hearts of the rest were hardened.",
                "As the Scriptures say, \u201cGod has put them into a deep sleep.",
                "To this day he has shut their eyes so they do not see, and closed their ears so they do not hear.\u201d",
                "Likewise, David said, \u201cLet their bountiful table become a snare, a trap that makes them think all is well.",
                "Let their blessings cause them to stumble, and let them get what they deserve.",
                "Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see, and let their backs be bent forever.\u201d",
                "Did God\u2019s people stumble and fall beyond recovery?",
                "Of course not!",
                "They were disobedient, so God made salvation available to the Gentiles.",
                "But he wanted his own people to become jealous and claim it for themselves.",
                "Now if the Gentiles were enriched because the people of Israel turned down God\u2019s offer of salvation, think how much greater a blessing the world will share when they finally accept it.",
                "I am saying all this especially for you Gentiles.",
                "God has appointed me as the apostle to the Gentiles.",
                "I stress this, for I want somehow to make the people of Israel jealous of what you Gentiles have, so I might save some of them.",
                "For since their rejection meant that God offered salvation to the rest of the world, their acceptance will be even more wonderful.",
                "It will be life for those who were dead!",
                "And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy\u2014just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy.",
                "For if the roots of the tree are holy, the branches will be, too.",
                "But some of these branches from Abraham\u2019s tree\u2014some of the people of Israel\u2014have been broken off.",
                "And you Gentiles, who were branches from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in.",
                "So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God\u2019s special olive tree.",
                "But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off.",
                "You are just a branch, not the root.",
                "\u201cWell,\u201d you may say, \u201cthose branches were broken off to make room for me.\u201d",
                "Yes, but remember\u2014those branches were broken off because they didn\u2019t believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe.",
                "So don\u2019t think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen.",
                "For if God did not spare the original branches, he won\u2019t spare you either.",
                "Notice how God is both kind and severe.",
                "He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness.",
                "But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off.",
                "And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree.",
                "You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree.",
                "So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong.",
                "I want you to understand this mystery, dear brothers and sisters, so that you will not feel proud about yourselves.",
                "Some of the people of Israel have hard hearts, but this will last only until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ.",
                "And so all Israel will be saved.",
                "As the Scriptures say, \u201cThe one who rescues will come from Jerusalem, and he will turn Israel away from ungodliness.",
                "And this is my covenant with them, that I will take away their sins.\u201d",
                "Many of the people of Israel are now enemies of the Good News, and this benefits you Gentiles.",
                "Yet they are still the people he loves because he chose their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.",
                "For God\u2019s gifts and his call can never be withdrawn.",
                "Once, you Gentiles were rebels against God, but when the people of Israel rebelled against him, God was merciful to you instead.",
                "Now they are the rebels, and God\u2019s mercy has come to you so that they, too, will share in God\u2019s mercy.",
                "For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone.",
                "Oh, how great are God\u2019s riches and wisdom and knowledge!",
                "How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways!",
                "For who can know the Lord\u2019s thoughts?",
                "Who knows enough to give him advice?",
                "And who has given him so much that he needs to pay it back?",
                "For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory.",
                "All glory to him forever!",
                "Amen. \n\n",
                "And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you.",
                "Let them be a living and holy sacrifice\u2014the kind he will find acceptable.",
                "This is truly the way to worship him.",
                "Don\u2019t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.",
                "Then you will learn to know God\u2019s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.",
                "Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning: Don\u2019t think you are better than you really are.",
                "Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us.",
                "Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, so it is with Christ\u2019s body.",
                "We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.",
                "In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well.",
                "So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you.",
                "If your gift is serving others, serve them well.",
                "If you are a teacher, teach well.",
                "If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging.",
                "If it is giving, give generously.",
                "If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously.",
                "And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.",
                "Don\u2019t just pretend to love others.",

                "Everyone must submit to governing authorities.",
                "For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God.",
                "So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished.",
                "For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong.",
                "Would you like to live without fear of the authorities?",
                "Do what is right, and they will honor you.",
                "The authorities are God\u2019s servants, sent for your good.",
                "But if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid, for they have the power to punish you.",
                "They are God\u2019s servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong.",
                "So you must submit to them, not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience.",
                "Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons.",

                "Owe nothing to anyone\u2014except for your obligation to love one another.",
                "If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God\u2019s law.",

                "But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables.",
                "Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don\u2019t.",

                "You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable.",
                "Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him.",
                "Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating.",
                "And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God.",
                "For we don\u2019t live for ourselves or die for ourselves.",
                "If we live, it\u2019s to honor the Lord.",
                "And if we die, it\u2019s to honor the Lord.",
                "So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.",
                "Christ died and rose again for this very purpose\u2014to be Lord both of the living and of the dead.",

                "Remember, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.",
                "For the Scriptures say, \u201c\u2018As surely as I live,\u2019 says the Lord, \u2018every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will declare allegiance to God.\u2019\u201d",
                "Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God.",

                "I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat.",
                "But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong.",
                "And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it.",
                "Don\u2019t let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died.",
                "Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good.",
                "For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.",
                "If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too.",
                "So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up.",
                "Don\u2019t tear apart the work of God over what you eat.",
                "Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble.",
                "It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble.",
                "You may believe there\u2019s nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God.",
                "Blessed are those who don\u2019t feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right.",
                "But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it.",

        "Galatians": {
            "text": "This letter is from Paul, an apostle. I was not appointed by any group of people or any human authority, but by Jesus Christ himself and by God the Father, who raised Jesus from the dead. All the brothers and sisters here join me in sending this letter to the churches of Galatia. May God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. Jesus gave his life for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live. All glory to God forever and ever! Amen. I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ. Let God\u2019s curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed. Obviously, I\u2019m not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ\u2019s servant. Dear brothers and sisters, I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human reasoning. I received my message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it by direct revelation from Jesus Christ. You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion\u2014how I violently persecuted God\u2019s church. I did my best to destroy it. I was far ahead of my fellow Jews in my zeal for the traditions of my ancestors. But even before I was born, God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace. Then it pleased him to reveal his Son to me so that I would proclaim the Good News about Jesus to the Gentiles. When this happened, I did not rush out to consult with any human being. Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away into Arabia, and later I returned to the city of Damascus. Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to get to know Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days. The only other apostle I met at that time was James, the Lord\u2019s brother. I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie. After that visit I went north into the provinces of Syria and Cilicia. And still the churches in Christ that are in Judea didn\u2019t know me personally. All they knew was that people were saying, \u201cThe one who used to persecute us is now preaching the very faith he tried to destroy!\u201d And they praised God because of me. \n\nThen fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas; and Titus came along, too. I went there because God revealed to me that I should go. While I was there I met privately with those considered to be leaders of the church and shared with them the message I had been preaching to the Gentiles. I wanted to make sure that we were in agreement, for fear that all my efforts had been wasted and I was running the race for nothing. And they supported me and did not even demand that my companion Titus be circumcised, though he was a Gentile. Even that question came up only because of some so-called believers there\u2014false ones, really\u2014who were secretly brought in. They sneaked in to spy on us and take away the freedom we have in Christ Jesus. They wanted to enslave us and force us to follow their Jewish regulations. But we refused to give in to them for a single moment. We wanted to preserve the truth of the gospel message for you. And the leaders of the church had nothing to add to what I was preaching. (By the way, their reputation as great leaders made no difference to me, for God has no favorites.) Instead, they saw that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the responsibility of preaching to the Jews. For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles. In fact, James, Peter, and John, who were known as pillars of the church, recognized the gift God had given me, and they accepted Barnabas and me as their co-workers. They encouraged us to keep preaching to the Gentiles, while they continued their work with the Jews. Their only suggestion was that we keep on helping the poor, which I have always been eager to do. But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong. When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile believers, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when some friends of James came, Peter wouldn\u2019t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision. As a result, other Jewish believers followed Peter\u2019s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. When I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I said to Peter in front of all the others, \u201cSince you, a Jew by birth, have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like a Gentile, why are you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions? \u201cYou and I are Jews by birth, not \u2018sinners\u2019 like the Gentiles. Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.\u201d But suppose we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then we are found guilty because we have abandoned the law. Would that mean Christ has led us into sin? Absolutely not! Rather, I am a sinner if I rebuild the old system of law I already tore down. For when I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law\u2014I stopped trying to meet all its requirements\u2014so that I might live for God. My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right with God, then there was no need for Christ to die. \n\nOh, foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning of Jesus Christ\u2019s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross. Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of course not! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ. How foolish can you be? After starting your new lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort? Have you experienced so much for nothing? Surely it was not in vain, was it? I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ. In the same way, \u201cAbraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.\u201d The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God. What\u2019s more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would make the Gentiles right in his sight because of their faith. God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, \u201cAll nations will be blessed through you.\u201d So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith. But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, \u201cCursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God\u2019s Book of the Law.\u201d So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, \u201cIt is through faith that a righteous person has life.\u201d This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, \u201cIt is through obeying the law that a person has life.\u201d But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, \u201cCursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.\u201d Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith. Dear brothers and sisters, here\u2019s an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement, so it is in this case. God gave the promises to Abraham and his child. And notice that the Scripture doesn\u2019t say \u201cto his children,\u201d as if it meant many descendants. Rather, it says \u201cto his child\u201d\u2014and that, of course, means Christ. This is what I am trying to say: The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses. God would be breaking his promise. For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God\u2019s promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise. Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people. Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham. Is there a conflict, then, between God\u2019s law and God\u2019s promises? Absolutely not! If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it. But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God\u2019s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ. Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed. Let me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith. And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian. For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes. There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God\u2019s promise to Abraham belongs to you. \n\nThink of it this way. If a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children, those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up, even though they actually own everything their father had. They have to obey their guardians until they reach whatever age their father set. And that\u2019s the way it was with us before Christ came. We were like children; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles of this world. But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law. God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children. And because we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d Now you are no longer a slave but God\u2019s own child. And since you are his child, God has made you his heir. Before you Gentiles knew God, you were slaves to so-called gods that do not even exist. So now that you know God (or should I say, now that God knows you), why do you want to go back again and become slaves once more to the weak and useless spiritual principles of this world? You are trying to earn favor with God by observing certain days or months or seasons or years. I fear for you. Perhaps all my hard work with you was for nothing. Dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to live as I do in freedom from these things, for I have become like you Gentiles\u2014free from those laws. You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you. Surely you remember that I was sick when I first brought you the Good News. But even though my condition tempted you to reject me, you did not despise me or turn me away. No, you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself. Where is that joyful and grateful spirit you felt then? I am sure you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if it had been possible. Have I now become your enemy because I am telling you the truth? Those false teachers are so eager to win your favor, but their intentions are not good. They are trying to shut you off from me so that you will pay attention only to them. If someone is eager to do good things for you, that\u2019s all right; but let them do it all the time, not just when I\u2019m with you. Oh, my dear children! I feel as if I\u2019m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives. I wish I were with you right now so I could change my tone. But at this distance I don\u2019t know how else to help you. Tell me, you who want to live under the law, do you know what the law actually says? The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons, one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife. The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God\u2019s promise. But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God\u2019s own fulfillment of his promise. These two women serve as an illustration of God\u2019s two covenants. The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them. And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia, because she and her children live in slavery to the law. But the other woman, Sarah, represents the heavenly Jerusalem. She is the free woman, and she is our mother. As Isaiah said, \u201cRejoice, O childless woman, you who have never given birth! Break into a joyful shout, you who have never been in labor! For the desolate woman now has more children than the woman who lives with her husband!\u201d And you, dear brothers and sisters, are children of the promise, just like Isaac. But you are now being persecuted by those who want you to keep the law, just as Ishmael, the child born by human effort, persecuted Isaac, the child born by the power of the Spirit. But what do the Scriptures say about that? \u201cGet rid of the slave and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the free woman\u2019s son.\u201d So, dear brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman; we are children of the free woman. \n\nSo Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don\u2019t get tied up again in slavery to the law. Listen! I, Paul, tell you this: If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God, then Christ will be of no benefit to you. I\u2019ll say it again. If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses. For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God\u2019s grace. But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us. For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised. What is important is faith expressing itself in love. You were running the race so well. Who has held you back from following the truth? It certainly isn\u2019t God, for he is the one who called you to freedom. This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough! I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings. God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you. Dear brothers and sisters, if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised\u2014as some say I do\u2014why am I still being persecuted? If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ, no one would be offended. I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves. For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don\u2019t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love. For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another. So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won\u2019t be doing what your sinful nature craves. The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions. But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses. When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God. But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things! Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there. Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit\u2019s leading in every part of our lives. Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another. \n\nDear brothers and sisters, if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself. Share each other\u2019s burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ. If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important. Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won\u2019t need to compare yourself to anyone else. For we are each responsible for our own conduct. Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them. Don\u2019t be misled\u2014you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. So let\u2019s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don\u2019t give up. Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone\u2014especially to those in the family of faith. Notice what large letters i use as i write these closing words in my own handwriting. Those who are trying to force you to be circumcised want to look good to others. They don\u2019t want to be persecuted for teaching that the cross of Christ alone can save. And even those who advocate circumcision don\u2019t keep the whole law themselves. They only want you to be circumcised so they can boast about it and claim you as their disciples. As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world\u2019s interest in me has also died. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we have been circumcised or not. What counts is whether we have been transformed into a new creation. May God\u2019s peace and mercy be upon all who live by this principle; they are the new people of God. From now on, don\u2019t let anyone trouble me with these things. For I bear on my body the scars that show I belong to Jesus. Dear brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. \n\n",

                "For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles.",
                "In fact, James, Peter, and John, who were known as pillars of the church, recognized the gift God had given me, and they accepted Barnabas and me as their co-workers.",

                "Surely it was not in vain, was it?",
                "I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law?",
                "Of course not!",
                "It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ.",
                "In the same way, \u201cAbraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.\u201d",
                "The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God.",
                "What\u2019s more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would make the Gentiles right in his sight because of their faith.",
                "God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, \u201cAll nations will be blessed through you.\u201d",
                "So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.",
                "But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, \u201cCursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God\u2019s Book of the Law.\u201d",
                "So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law.",
                "For the Scriptures say, \u201cIt is through faith that a righteous person has life.\u201d",
                "This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, \u201cIt is through obeying the law that a person has life.\u201d",
                "But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law.",
                "When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing.",
                "For it is written in the Scriptures, \u201cCursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.\u201d",
                "Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, here\u2019s an example from everyday life.",
                "Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement, so it is in this case.",
                "God gave the promises to Abraham and his child.",
                "And notice that the Scripture doesn\u2019t say \u201cto his children,\u201d as if it meant many descendants.",
                "Rather, it says \u201cto his child\u201d\u2014and that, of course, means Christ.",
                "This is what I am trying to say: The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses.",
                "God would be breaking his promise.",
                "For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God\u2019s promise.",
                "But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise.",
                "Why, then, was the law given?",
                "It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins.",
                "But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised.",
                "God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.",
                "Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement.",
                "But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham.",
                "Is there a conflict, then, between God\u2019s law and God\u2019s promises?",
                "Absolutely not!",
                "If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it.",
                "But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God\u2019s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ.",
                "Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law.",
                "We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.",
                "Let me put it another way.",
                "The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith.",
                "And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian.",
                "For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.",
                "And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes.",
                "There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female.",
                "For you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
                "And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham.",
                "You are his heirs, and God\u2019s promise to Abraham belongs to you. \n\n",
                "Think of it this way.",
                "If a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children, those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up, even though they actually own everything their father had.",
                "They have to obey their guardians until they reach whatever age their father set.",
                "And that\u2019s the way it was with us before Christ came.",
                "We were like children; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles of this world.",
                "But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law.",
                "God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children.",
                "And because we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d",
                "Now you are no longer a slave but God\u2019s own child.",
                "And since you are his child, God has made you his heir.",
                "Before you Gentiles knew God, you were slaves to so-called gods that do not even exist.",
                "So now that you know God (or should I say, now that God knows you), why do you want to go back again and become slaves once more to the weak and useless spiritual principles of this world?",
                "You are trying to earn favor with God by observing certain days or months or seasons or years.",
                "I fear for you.",
                "Perhaps all my hard work with you was for nothing.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to live as I do in freedom from these things, for I have become like you Gentiles\u2014free from those laws.",
                "You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you.",
                "Surely you remember that I was sick when I first brought you the Good News.",
                "But even though my condition tempted you to reject me, you did not despise me or turn me away.",
                "No, you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself.",
                "Where is that joyful and grateful spirit you felt then?",
                "I am sure you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if it had been possible.",
                "Have I now become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?",
                "Those false teachers are so eager to win your favor, but their intentions are not good.",
                "They are trying to shut you off from me so that you will pay attention only to them.",
                "If someone is eager to do good things for you, that\u2019s all right; but let them do it all the time, not just when I\u2019m with you.",
                "Oh, my dear children!",
                "I feel as if I\u2019m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives.",
                "I wish I were with you right now",
                "so I could change my tone.",
                "But at this distance I don\u2019t know how else to help you.",
                "Tell me, you who want to live under the law, do you know what the law actually says?",
                "The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons, one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife.",
                "The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God\u2019s promise.",
                "But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God\u2019s own fulfillment of his promise.",
                "These two women serve as an illustration of God\u2019s two covenants.",
                "The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them.",
                "And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia, because she and her children live in slavery to the law.",
                "But the other woman, Sarah, represents the heavenly Jerusalem.",
                "She is the free woman, and she is our mother.",
                "As Isaiah said, \u201cRejoice, O childless woman, you who have never given birth!",
                "Break into a joyful shout, you who have never been in labor!",
                "For the desolate woman now has more children than the woman who lives with her husband!\u201d",
                "And you, dear brothers and sisters, are children of the promise, just like Isaac.",
                "But you are now being persecuted by those who want you to keep the law, just as Ishmael, the child born by human effort, persecuted Isaac, the child born by the power of the Spirit.",
                "But what do the Scriptures say about that?",
                "\u201cGet rid of the slave and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the free woman\u2019s son.\u201d",
                "So, dear brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman; we are children of the free woman. \n\n",
                "So Christ has truly set us free.",
                "Now make sure that you stay free, and don\u2019t get tied up again in slavery to the law.",
                "Listen!",
                "I, Paul, tell you this: If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God, then Christ will be of no benefit to you.",
                "I\u2019ll say it again.",
                "If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses.",
                "For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ!",
                "You have fallen away from God\u2019s grace.",
                "But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us.",
                "For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised.",
                "What is important is faith expressing itself in love.",
                "You were running the race so well.",
                "Who has held you back from following the truth?",
                "It certainly isn\u2019t God, for he is the one who called you to freedom.",
                "This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough!",
                "I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings.",
                "God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised\u2014as some say I do\u2014why am I still being persecuted?",
                "If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ, no one would be offended.",
                "I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves.",

                "Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love.",

                "Beware of destroying one another.",
                "So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives.",
                "Then you won\u2019t be doing what your sinful nature craves.",

            "text": "This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Sosthenes. I am writing to God\u2019s church in Corinth, to you who have been called by God to be his own holy people. He made you holy by means of Christ Jesus, just as he did for all people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to Christ Jesus. Through him, God has enriched your church in every way\u2014with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge. This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true. Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose. For some members of Chloe\u2019s household have told me about your quarrels, my dear brothers and sisters. Some of you are saying, \u201cI am a follower of Paul.\u201d Others are saying, \u201cI follow Apollos,\u201d or \u201cI follow Peter,\u201d or \u201cI follow only Christ.\u201d Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I, Paul, crucified for you? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul? Of course not! I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, for now no one can say they were baptized in my name. (Oh yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but I don\u2019t remember baptizing anyone else.) For Christ didn\u2019t send me to baptize, but to preach the Good News\u2014and not with clever speech, for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power. The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God. As the Scriptures say, \u201cI will destroy the wisdom of the wise and discard the intelligence of the intelligent.\u201d So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world\u2019s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it\u2019s all nonsense. But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God\u2019s weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength. Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world\u2019s eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you. Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful. God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important. As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God. God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin. Therefore, as the Scriptures say, \u201cIf you want to boast, boast only about the Lord.\u201d \n\nWhen I first came to you, dear brothers and sisters, I didn\u2019t use lofty words and impressive wisdom to tell you God\u2019s secret plan. For I decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Jesus Christ, the one who was crucified. I came to you in weakness\u2014timid and trembling. And my message and my preaching were very plain. Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches, I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit. I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God. Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten. No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God\u2014his plan that was previously hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began. But the rulers of this world have not understood it; if they had, they would not have crucified our glorious Lord. That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, \u201cNo eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.\u201d But it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God\u2019s deep secrets. No one can know a person\u2019s thoughts except that person\u2019s own spirit, and no one can know God\u2019s thoughts except God\u2019s own Spirit. And we have received God\u2019s Spirit (not the world\u2019s spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us. When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit\u2019s words to explain spiritual truths. But people who aren\u2019t spiritual can\u2019t receive these truths from God\u2019s Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can\u2019t understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means. Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others. For, \u201cWho can know the Lord\u2019s thoughts? Who knows enough to teach him?\u201d But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ. \n\nDear brothers and sisters, when I was with you I couldn\u2019t talk to you as I would to spiritual people. I had to talk as though you belonged to this world or as though you were infants in Christ. I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren\u2019t ready for anything stronger. And you still aren\u2019t ready, for you are still controlled by your sinful nature. You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. Doesn\u2019t that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature? Aren\u2019t you living like people of the world? When one of you says, \u201cI am a follower of Paul,\u201d and another says, \u201cI follow Apollos,\u201d aren\u2019t you acting just like people of the world? After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God\u2019s servants through whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave us. I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow. It\u2019s not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. What\u2019s important is that God makes the seed grow. The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose. And both will be rewarded for their own hard work. For we are both God\u2019s workers. And you are God\u2019s field. You are God\u2019s building. Because of God\u2019s grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert builder. Now others are building on it. But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have\u2014Jesus Christ. Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials\u2014gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw. But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done. The fire will show if a person\u2019s work has any value. If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward. But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builder will be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames. Don\u2019t you realize that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you? God will destroy anyone who destroys this temple. For God\u2019s temple is holy, and you are that temple. Stop deceiving yourselves. If you think you are wise by this world\u2019s standards, you need to become a fool to be truly wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say, \u201cHe traps the wise in the snare of their own cleverness.\u201d And again, \u201cThe Lord knows the thoughts of the wise; he knows they are worthless.\u201d So don\u2019t boast about following a particular human leader. For everything belongs to you\u2014 whether Paul or Apollos or Peter, or the world, or life and death, or the present and the future. Everything belongs to you, and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. \n\nSo look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God\u2019s mysteries. Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful. As for me, it matters very little how I might be evaluated by you or by any human authority. I don\u2019t even trust my own judgment on this point. My conscience is clear, but that doesn\u2019t prove I\u2019m right. It is the Lord himself who will examine me and decide. So don\u2019t make judgments about anyone ahead of time\u2014before the Lord returns. For he will bring our darkest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives. Then God will give to each one whatever praise is due. Dear brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself to illustrate what I\u2019ve been saying. If you pay attention to what I have quoted from the Scriptures, you won\u2019t be proud of one of your leaders at the expense of another. For what gives you the right to make such a judgment? What do you have that God hasn\u2019t given you? And if everything you have is from God, why boast as though it were not a gift? You think you already have everything you need. You think you are already rich. You have begun to reign in God\u2019s kingdom without us! I wish you really were reigning already, for then we would be reigning with you. Instead, I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners of war at the end of a victor\u2019s parade, condemned to die. We have become a spectacle to the entire world\u2014to people and angels alike. Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools, but you claim to be so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are so powerful! You are honored, but we are ridiculed. Even now we go hungry and thirsty, and we don\u2019t have enough clothes to keep warm. We are often beaten and have no home. We work wearily with our own hands to earn our living. We bless those who curse us. We are patient with those who abuse us. We appeal gently when evil things are said about us. Yet we are treated like the world\u2019s garbage, like everybody\u2019s trash\u2014right up to the present moment. I am not writing these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children. For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have only one spiritual father. For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you. So I urge you to imitate me. That\u2019s why I have sent Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus, just as I teach in all the churches wherever I go. Some of you have become arrogant, thinking I will not visit you again. But I will come\u2014and soon\u2014if the Lord lets me, and then I\u2019ll find out whether these arrogant people just give pretentious speeches or whether they really have God\u2019s power. For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk; it is living by God\u2019s power. Which do you choose? Should I come with a rod to punish you, or should I come with love and a gentle spirit? \n\nI can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you\u2014something that even pagans don\u2019t do. I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother. You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame. And you should remove this man from your fellowship. Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit. And as though I were there, I have already passed judgment on this man in the name of the Lord Jesus. You must call a meeting of the church. I will be present with you in spirit, and so will the power of our Lord Jesus. Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed and he himself will be saved on the day the Lord returns. Your boasting about this is terrible. Don\u2019t you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old \u201cyeast\u201d by removing this wicked person from among you. Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us. So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread of sincerity and truth. When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin. But I wasn\u2019t talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that. I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don\u2019t even eat with such people. It isn\u2019t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning. God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, \u201cYou must remove the evil person from among you.\u201d \n\nWhen one of you has a dispute with another believer, how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers! Don\u2019t you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can\u2019t you decide even these little things among yourselves? Don\u2019t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life. If you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church? I am saying this to shame you. Isn\u2019t there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues? But instead, one believer sues another\u2014right in front of unbelievers! Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated? Instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers. Don\u2019t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don\u2019t fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people\u2014none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God. Some of you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. You say, \u201cI am allowed to do anything\u201d\u2014but not everything is good for you. And even though \u201cI am allowed to do anything,\u201d I must not become a slave to anything. You say, \u201cFood was made for the stomach, and the stomach for food.\u201d (This is true, though someday God will do away with both of them.) But you can\u2019t say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality. They were made for the Lord, and the Lord cares about our bodies. And God will raise us from the dead by his power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead. Don\u2019t you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ? Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ, and join it to a prostitute? Never! And don\u2019t you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, \u201cThe two are united into one.\u201d But the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him. Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. Don\u2019t you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself, for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body. \n\nNow regarding the questions you asked in your letter. Yes, it is good to abstain from sexual relations. But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. The husband should fulfill his wife\u2019s sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband\u2019s needs. The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife. Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won\u2019t be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control. I say this as a concession, not as a command. But I wish everyone were single, just as I am. Yet each person has a special gift from God, of one kind or another. So I say to those who aren\u2019t married and to widows\u2014it\u2019s better to stay unmarried, just as I am. But if they can\u2019t control themselves, they should go ahead and marry. It\u2019s better to marry than to burn with lust. But for those who are married, I have a command that comes not from me, but from the Lord. A wife must not leave her husband. But if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be reconciled to him. And the husband must not leave his wife. Now, I will speak to the rest of you, though I do not have a direct command from the Lord. If a fellow believer has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to continue living with him, he must not leave her. And if a believing woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to continue living with her, she must not leave him. For the believing wife brings holiness to her marriage, and the believing husband brings holiness to his marriage. Otherwise, your children would not be holy, but now they are holy. (But if the husband or wife who isn\u2019t a believer insists on leaving, let them go. In such cases the believing husband or wife is no longer bound to the other, for God has called you to live in peace.) Don\u2019t you wives realize that your husbands might be saved because of you? And don\u2019t you husbands realize that your wives might be saved because of you? Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you, and remain as you were when God first called you. This is my rule for all the churches. For instance, a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it. And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now. For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God\u2019s commandments. Yes, each of you should remain as you were when God called you. Are you a slave? Don\u2019t let that worry you\u2014but if you get a chance to be free, take it. And remember, if you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free in the Lord. And if you were free when the Lord called you, you are now a slave of Christ. God paid a high price for you, so don\u2019t be enslaved by the world. Each of you, dear brothers and sisters, should remain as you were when God first called you. Now regarding your question about the young women who are not yet married. I do not have a command from the Lord for them. But the Lord in his mercy has given me wisdom that can be trusted, and I will share it with you. Because of the present crisis, I think it is best to remain as you are. If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage. If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married. But if you do get married, it is not a sin. And if a young woman gets married, it is not a sin. However, those who get married at this time will have troubles, and I am trying to spare you those problems. But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage. Those who weep or who rejoice or who buy things should not be absorbed by their weeping or their joy or their possessions. Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them. For this world as we know it will soon pass away. I want you to be free from the concerns of this life. An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord\u2019s work and thinking how to please him. But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife. His interests are divided. In the same way, a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit. But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband. I am saying this for your benefit, not to place restrictions on you. I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best, with as few distractions as possible. But if a man thinks that he\u2019s treating his fianc\u00e9e improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin. But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion, he does well not to marry. So the person who marries his fianc\u00e9e does well, and the person who doesn\u2019t marry does even better. A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord. But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single, and I think I am giving you counsel from God\u2019s Spirit when I say this. \n\nNow regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols. Yes, we know that \u201cwe all have knowledge\u201d about this issue. But while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church. Anyone who claims to know all the answers doesn\u2019t really know very much. But the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes. So, what about eating meat that has been offered to idols? Well, we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God. There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth, and some people actually worship many gods and many lords. But for us, There is one God, the Father, by whom all things were created, and for whom we live. And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created, and through whom we live. However, not all believers know this. Some are accustomed to thinking of idols as being real, so when they eat food that has been offered to idols, they think of it as the worship of real gods, and their weak consciences are violated. It\u2019s true that we can\u2019t win God\u2019s approval by what we eat. We don\u2019t lose anything if we don\u2019t eat it, and we don\u2019t gain anything if we do. But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble. For if others see you\u2014with your \u201csuperior knowledge\u201d\u2014eating in the temple of an idol, won\u2019t they be encouraged to violate their conscience by eating food that has been offered to an idol? So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer for whom Christ died will be destroyed. And when you sin against other believers by encouraging them to do something they believe is wrong, you are sinning against Christ. So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as long as I live\u2014for I don\u2019t want to cause another believer to stumble. \n\nAm I not as free as anyone else? Am I not an apostle? Haven\u2019t I seen Jesus our Lord with my own eyes? Isn\u2019t it because of my work that you belong to the Lord? Even if others think I am not an apostle, I certainly am to you. You yourselves are proof that I am the Lord\u2019s apostle. This is my answer to those who question my authority. Don\u2019t we have the right to live in your homes and share your meals? Don\u2019t we have the right to bring a believing wife with us as the other apostles and the Lord\u2019s brothers do, and as Peter does? Or is it only Barnabas and I who have to work to support ourselves? What soldier has to pay his own expenses? What farmer plants a vineyard and doesn\u2019t have the right to eat some of its fruit? What shepherd cares for a flock of sheep and isn\u2019t allowed to drink some of the milk? Am I expressing merely a human opinion, or does the law say the same thing? For the law of Moses says, \u201cYou must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.\u201d Was God thinking only about oxen when he said this? Wasn\u2019t he actually speaking to us? Yes, it was written for us, so that the one who plows and the one who threshes the grain might both expect a share of the harvest. Since we have planted spiritual seed among you, aren\u2019t we entitled to a harvest of physical food and drink? If you support others who preach to you, shouldn\u2019t we have an even greater right to be supported? But we have never used this right. We would rather put up with anything than be an obstacle to the Good News about Christ. Don\u2019t you realize that those who work in the temple get their meals from the offerings brought to the temple? And those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings. In the same way, the Lord ordered that those who preach the Good News should be supported by those who benefit from it. Yet I have never used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that I want to start now. In fact, I would rather die than lose my right to boast about preaching without charge. Yet preaching the Good News is not something I can boast about. I am compelled by God to do it. How terrible for me if I didn\u2019t preach the Good News! If I were doing this on my own initiative, I would deserve payment. But I have no choice, for God has given me this sacred trust. What then is my pay? It is the opportunity to preach the Good News without charging anyone. That\u2019s why I never demand my rights when I preach the Good News. Even though I am a free man with no master, I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ. When I was with the Jews, I lived like a Jew to bring the Jews to Christ. When I was with those who follow the Jewish law, I too lived under that law. Even though I am not subject to the law, I did this so I could bring to Christ those who are under the law. When I am with the Gentiles who do not follow the Jewish law, I too live apart from that law so I can bring them to Christ. But I do not ignore the law of God; I obey the law of Christ. When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some. I do everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings. Don\u2019t you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified. \n\nI don\u2019t want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters, about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago. All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them, and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground. In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptized as followers of Moses. All of them ate the same spiritual food, and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them, and that rock was Christ. Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness. These things happened as a warning to us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did, or worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, \u201cThe people celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.\u201d And we must not engage in sexual immorality as some of them did, causing 23,000 of them to die in one day. Nor should we put Christ to the test, as some of them did and then died from snakebites. And don\u2019t grumble as some of them did, and then were destroyed by the angel of death. These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age. If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall. The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure. So, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols. You are reasonable people. Decide for yourselves if what I am saying is true. When we bless the cup at the Lord\u2019s Table, aren\u2019t we sharing in the blood of Christ? And when we break the bread, aren\u2019t we sharing in the body of Christ? And though we are many, we all eat from one loaf of bread, showing that we are one body. Think about the people of Israel. Weren\u2019t they united by eating the sacrifices at the altar? What am I trying to say? Am I saying that food offered to idols has some significance, or that idols are real gods? No, not at all. I am saying that these sacrifices are offered to demons, not to God. And I don\u2019t want you to participate with demons. You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of demons, too. You cannot eat at the Lord\u2019s Table and at the table of demons, too. What? Do we dare to rouse the Lord\u2019s jealousy? Do you think we are stronger than he is? You say, \u201cI am allowed to do anything\u201d\u2014but not everything is good for you. You say, \u201cI am allowed to do anything\u201d\u2014but not everything is beneficial. Don\u2019t be concerned for your own good but for the good of others. So you may eat any meat that is sold in the marketplace without raising questions of conscience. For \u201cthe earth is the Lord\u2019s, and everything in it.\u201d If someone who isn\u2019t a believer asks you home for dinner, accept the invitation if you want to. Eat whatever is offered to you without raising questions of conscience. (But suppose someone tells you, \u201cThis meat was offered to an idol.\u201d Don\u2019t eat it, out of consideration for the conscience of the one who told you. It might not be a matter of conscience for you, but it is for the other person.) For why should my freedom be limited by what someone else thinks? If I can thank God for the food and enjoy it, why should I be condemned for eating it? So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. Don\u2019t give offense to Jews or Gentiles or the church of God. I, too, try to please everyone in everything I do. I don\u2019t just do what is best for me; I do what is best for others so that many may be saved. \n\nAnd you should imitate me, just as I imitate Christ. I am so glad that you always keep me in your thoughts, and that you are following the teachings I passed on to you. But there is one thing I want you to know: The head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. A man dishonors his head if he covers his head while praying or prophesying. But a woman dishonors her head if she prays or prophesies without a covering on her head, for this is the same as shaving her head. Yes, if she refuses to wear a head covering, she should cut off all her hair! But since it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved, she should wear a covering. A man should not wear anything on his head when worshiping, for man is made in God\u2019s image and reflects God\u2019s glory. And woman reflects man\u2019s glory. For the first man didn\u2019t come from woman, but the first woman came from man. And man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man. For this reason, and because the angels are watching, a woman should wear a covering on her head to show she is under authority. But among the Lord\u2019s people, women are not independent of men, and men are not independent of women. For although the first woman came from man, every other man was born from a woman, and everything comes from God. Judge for yourselves. Is it right for a woman to pray to God in public without covering her head? Isn\u2019t it obvious that it\u2019s disgraceful for a man to have long hair? And isn\u2019t long hair a woman\u2019s pride and joy? For it has been given to her as a covering. But if anyone wants to argue about this, I simply say that we have no other custom than this, and neither do God\u2019s other churches. But in the following instructions, I cannot praise you. For it sounds as if more harm than good is done when you meet together. First, I hear that there are divisions among you when you meet as a church, and to some extent I believe it. But, of course, there must be divisions among you so that you who have God\u2019s approval will be recognized! When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord\u2019s Supper. For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry while others get drunk. What? Don\u2019t you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace God\u2019s church and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly will not praise you for this! For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, \u201cThis is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u201d In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant between God and his people\u2014an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it.\u201d For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord\u2019s death until he comes again. So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup. For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honoring the body of Christ, you are eating and drinking God\u2019s judgment upon yourself. That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died. But if we would examine ourselves, we would not be judged by God in this way. Yet when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned along with the world. So, my dear brothers and sisters, when you gather for the Lord\u2019s Supper, wait for each other. If you are really hungry, eat at home so you won\u2019t bring judgment upon yourselves when you meet together. I\u2019ll give you instructions about the other matters after I arrive. \n\nNow, dear brothers and sisters, regarding your question about the special abilities the Spirit gives us. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand this. You know that when you were still pagans, you were led astray and swept along in worshiping speechless idols. So I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God will curse Jesus, and no one can say Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit. There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us. A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same Spirit gives a message of special knowledge. The same Spirit gives great faith to another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy. He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit. Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages, while another is given the ability to interpret what is being said. It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have. The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. So it is with the body of Christ. Some of us are Jews, some are Gentiles, some are slaves, and some are free. But we have all been baptized into one body by one Spirit, and we all share the same Spirit. Yes, the body has many different parts, not just one part. If the foot says, \u201cI am not a part of the body because I am not a hand,\u201d that does not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear says, \u201cI am not part of the body because I am not an eye,\u201d would that make it any less a part of the body? If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything? But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants it. How strange a body would be if it had only one part! Yes, there are many parts, but only one body. The eye can never say to the hand, \u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201d The head can\u2019t say to the feet, \u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201d In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary. And the parts we regard as less honorable are those we clothe with the greatest care. So we carefully protect those parts that should not be seen, while the more honorable parts do not require this special care. So God has put the body together such that extra honor and care are given to those parts that have less dignity. This makes for harmony among the members, so that all the members care for each other. If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts are glad. All of you together are Christ\u2019s body, and each of you is a part of it. Here are some of the parts God has appointed for the church: first are apostles, second are prophets, third are teachers, then those who do miracles, those who have the gift of healing, those who can help others, those who have the gift of leadership, those who speak in unknown languages. Are we all apostles? Are we all prophets? Are we all teachers? Do we all have the power to do miracles? Do we all have the gift of healing? Do we all have the ability to speak in unknown languages? Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages? Of course not! So you should earnestly desire the most helpful gifts. But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all. \n\nIf I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn\u2019t love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God\u2019s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn\u2019t love others, I would be nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn\u2019t love others, I would have gained nothing. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge will become useless. But love will last forever! Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture! But when the time of perfection comes, these partial things will become useless. When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely. Three things will last forever\u2014faith, hope, and love\u2014and the greatest of these is love. \n\nLet love be your highest goal! But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives\u2014especially the ability to prophesy. For if you have the ability to speak in tongues, you will be talking only to God, since people won\u2019t be able to understand you. You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit, but it will all be mysterious. But one who prophesies strengthens others, encourages them, and comforts them. A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally, but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church. I wish you could all speak in tongues, but even more I wish you could all prophesy. For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues, unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church will be strengthened. Dear brothers and sisters, if I should come to you speaking in an unknown language, how would that help you? But if I bring you a revelation or some special knowledge or prophecy or teaching, that will be helpful. Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognize the melody. And if the bugler doesn\u2019t sound a clear call, how will the soldiers know they are being called to battle? It\u2019s the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don\u2019t understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space. There are many different languages in the world, and every language has meaning. But if I don\u2019t understand a language, I will be a foreigner to someone who speaks it, and the one who speaks it will be a foreigner to me. And the same is true for you. Since you are so eager to have the special abilities the Spirit gives, seek those that will strengthen the whole church. So anyone who speaks in tongues should pray also for the ability to interpret what has been said. For if I pray in tongues, my spirit is praying, but I don\u2019t understand what I am saying. Well then, what shall I do? I will pray in the spirit, and I will also pray in words I understand. I will sing in the spirit, and I will also sing in words I understand. For if you praise God only in the spirit, how can those who don\u2019t understand you praise God along with you? How can they join you in giving thanks when they don\u2019t understand what you are saying? You will be giving thanks very well, but it won\u2019t strengthen the people who hear you. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you. But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language. Dear brothers and sisters, don\u2019t be childish in your understanding of these things. Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil, but be mature in understanding matters of this kind. It is written in the Scriptures: \u201cI will speak to my own people through strange languages and through the lips of foreigners. But even then, they will not listen to me,\u201d says the Lord. So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers. Even so, if unbelievers or people who don\u2019t understand these things come into your church meeting and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language, they will think you are crazy. But if all of you are prophesying, and unbelievers or people who don\u2019t understand these things come into your meeting, they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say. As they listen, their secret thoughts will be exposed, and they will fall to their knees and worship God, declaring, \u201cGod is truly here among you.\u201d Well, my brothers and sisters, let\u2019s summarize. When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must strengthen all of you. No more than two or three should speak in tongues. They must speak one at a time, and someone must interpret what they say. But if no one is present who can interpret, they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately. Let two or three people prophesy, and let the others evaluate what is said. But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord, the one who is speaking must stop. In this way, all who prophesy will have a turn to speak, one after the other, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged. Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can take turns. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God\u2019s holy people. Women should be silent during the church meetings. It is not proper for them to speak. They should be submissive, just as the law says. If they have any questions, they should ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings. Or do you think God\u2019s word originated with you Corinthians? Are you the only ones to whom it was given? If you claim to be a prophet or think you are spiritual, you should recognize that what I am saying is a command from the Lord himself. But if you do not recognize this, you yourself will not be recognized. So, my dear brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and don\u2019t forbid speaking in tongues. But be sure that everything is done properly and in order. \n\nLet me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you\u2014unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place. I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him. For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I\u2019m not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God\u2019s church. But whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favor on me\u2014and not without results. For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace. So it makes no difference whether I preach or they preach, for we all preach the same message you have already believed. But tell me this\u2014since we preach that Christ rose from the dead, why are some of you saying there will be no resurrection of the dead? For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless. And we apostles would all be lying about God\u2014for we have said that God raised Christ from the grave. But that can\u2019t be true if there is no resurrection of the dead. And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins. In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost! And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world. But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead. He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died. So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man. Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam, everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life. But there is an order to this resurrection: Christ was raised as the first of the harvest; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back. After that the end will come, when he will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having destroyed every ruler and authority and power. For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet. And the last enemy to be destroyed is death. For the Scriptures say, \u201cGod has put all things under his authority.\u201d (Of course, when it says \u201call things are under his authority,\u201d that does not include God himself, who gave Christ his authority.) Then, when all things are under his authority, the Son will put himself under God\u2019s authority, so that God, who gave his Son authority over all things, will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere. If the dead will not be raised, what point is there in people being baptized for those who are dead? Why do it unless the dead will someday rise again? And why should we ourselves risk our lives hour by hour? For I swear, dear brothers and sisters, that I face death daily. This is as certain as my pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done in you. And what value was there in fighting wild beasts\u2014those people of Ephesus\u2014if there will be no resurrection from the dead? And if there is no resurrection, \u201cLet\u2019s feast and drink, for tomorrow we die!\u201d Don\u2019t be fooled by those who say such things, for \u201cbad company corrupts good character.\u201d Think carefully about what is right, and stop sinning. For to your shame I say that some of you don\u2019t know God at all. But someone may ask, \u201cHow will the dead be raised? What kind of bodies will they have?\u201d What a foolish question! When you put a seed into the ground, it doesn\u2019t grow into a plant unless it dies first. And what you put in the ground is not the plant that will grow, but only a bare seed of wheat or whatever you are planting. Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have. A different plant grows from each kind of seed. Similarly there are different kinds of flesh\u2014one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. There are also bodies in the heavens and bodies on the earth. The glory of the heavenly bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies. The sun has one kind of glory, while the moon and stars each have another kind. And even the stars differ from each other in their glory. It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead. Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever. Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength. They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there are also spiritual bodies. The Scriptures tell us, \u201cThe first man, Adam, became a living person.\u201d But the last Adam\u2014that is, Christ\u2014is a life-giving Spirit. What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later. Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, while Christ, the second man, came from heaven. Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man. Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like the heavenly man. What I am saying, dear brothers and sisters, is that our physical bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. These dying bodies cannot inherit what will last forever. But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed! It will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, when the last trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet sounds, those who have died will be raised to live forever. And we who are living will also be transformed. For our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die; our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies. Then, when our dying bodies have been transformed into bodies that will never die, this Scripture will be fulfilled: \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?\u201d For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power. But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ. So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and immovable. Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless. \n\nNow regarding your question about the money being collected for God\u2019s people in Jerusalem. You should follow the same procedure I gave to the churches in Galatia. On the first day of each week, you should each put aside a portion of the money you have earned. Don\u2019t wait until I get there and then try to collect it all at once. When I come, I will write letters of recommendation for the messengers you choose to deliver your gift to Jerusalem. And if it seems appropriate for me to go along, they can travel with me. I am coming to visit you after I have been to Macedonia, for I am planning to travel through Macedonia. Perhaps I will stay awhile with you, possibly all winter, and then you can send me on my way to my next destination. This time I don\u2019t want to make just a short visit and then go right on. I want to come and stay awhile, if the Lord will let me. In the meantime, I will be staying here at Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost. There is a wide-open door for a great work here, although many oppose me. When Timothy comes, don\u2019t intimidate him. He is doing the Lord\u2019s work, just as I am. Don\u2019t let anyone treat him with contempt. Send him on his way with your blessing when he returns to me. I expect him to come with the other believers. Now about our brother Apollos\u2014I urged him to visit you with the other believers, but he was not willing to go right now. He will see you later when he has the opportunity. Be on guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong. And do everything with love. You know that Stephanas and his household were the first of the harvest of believers in Greece, and they are spending their lives in service to God\u2019s people. I urge you, dear brothers and sisters, to submit to them and others like them who serve with such devotion. I am very glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come here. They have been providing the help you weren\u2019t here to give me. They have been a wonderful encouragement to me, as they have been to you. You must show your appreciation to all who serve so well. The churches here in the province of Asia send greetings in the Lord, as do Aquila and Priscilla and all the others who gather in their home for church meetings. All the brothers and sisters here send greetings to you. Greet each other with a sacred kiss. HERE IS MY GREETING IN MY OWN HANDWRITING\u2014PAUL. If anyone does not love the Lord, that person is cursed. Our Lord, come! May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. \n\n",

                "And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom.",
                "So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it\u2019s all nonsense.",

                "I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren\u2019t ready for anything stronger.",

                "Aren\u2019t you living like people of the world?",
                "When one of you says, \u201cI am a follower of Paul,\u201d and another says, \u201cI follow Apollos,\u201d aren\u2019t you acting just like people of the world?",
                "After all, who is Apollos?",
                "Who is Paul?",
                "We are only God\u2019s servants through whom you believed the Good News.",
                "Each of us did the work the Lord gave us.",
                "I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow.",
                "It\u2019s not important who does the planting, or who does the watering.",
                "What\u2019s important is that God makes the seed grow.",
                "The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose.",
                "And both will be rewarded for their own hard work.",
                "For we are both God\u2019s workers.",
                "And you are God\u2019s field.",
                "You are God\u2019s building.",
                "Because of God\u2019s grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert builder.",
                "Now others are building on it.",
                "But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful.",
                "For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have\u2014Jesus Christ.",
                "Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials\u2014gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw.",
                "But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done.",
                "The fire will show if a person\u2019s work has any value.",
                "If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward.",
                "But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss.",
                "The builder will be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames.",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you?",
                "God will destroy anyone who destroys this temple.",
                "For God\u2019s temple is holy, and you are that temple.",
                "Stop deceiving yourselves.",
                "If you think you are wise by this world\u2019s standards, you need to become a fool to be truly wise.",
                "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God.",
                "As the Scriptures say, \u201cHe traps the wise in the snare of their own cleverness.\u201d",
                "And again, \u201cThe Lord knows the thoughts of the wise; he knows they are worthless.\u201d",
                "So don\u2019t boast about following a particular human leader.",
                "For everything belongs to you\u2014 whether Paul or Apollos or Peter, or the world, or life and death, or the present and the future.",
                "Everything belongs to you, and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. \n\n",
                "So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God\u2019s mysteries.",
                "Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful.",
                "As for me, it matters very little how I might be evaluated by you or by any human authority.",
                "I don\u2019t even trust my own judgment on this point.",
                "My conscience is clear, but that doesn\u2019t prove I\u2019m right.",
                "It is the Lord himself who will examine me and decide.",
                "So don\u2019t make judgments about anyone ahead of time\u2014before the Lord returns.",
                "For he will bring our darkest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives.",
                "Then God will give to each one whatever praise is due.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself to illustrate what I\u2019ve been saying.",
                "If you pay attention to what I have quoted from the Scriptures, you won\u2019t be proud of one of your leaders at the expense of another.",
                "For what gives you the right to make such a judgment?",
                "What do you have that God hasn\u2019t given you?",
                "And if everything you have is from God, why boast as though it were not a gift?",
                "You think you already have everything you need.",
                "You think you are already rich.",
                "You have begun to reign in God\u2019s kingdom without us!",
                "I wish you really were reigning already, for then we would be reigning with you.",
                "Instead, I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners of war at the end of a victor\u2019s parade, condemned to die.",
                "We have become a spectacle to the entire world\u2014to people and angels alike.",
                "Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools, but you claim to be so wise in Christ!",
                "We are weak, but you are so powerful!",
                "You are honored, but we are ridiculed.",
                "Even now we go hungry and thirsty, and we don\u2019t have enough clothes to keep warm.",
                "We are often beaten and have no home.",
                "We work wearily with our own hands to earn our living.",
                "We bless those who curse us.",
                "We are patient with those who abuse us.",
                "We appeal gently when evil things are said about us.",
                "Yet we are treated like the world\u2019s garbage, like everybody\u2019s trash\u2014right up to the present moment.",
                "I am not writing these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.",
                "For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have only one spiritual father.",
                "For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you.",
                "So I urge you to imitate me.",
                "That\u2019s why I have sent Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord.",
                "He will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus, just as I teach in all the churches wherever I go.",
                "Some of you have become arrogant, thinking I will not visit you again.",
                "But I will come\u2014and soon\u2014if the Lord lets me, and then I\u2019ll find out whether these arrogant people just give pretentious speeches or whether they really have God\u2019s power.",
                "For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk; it is living by God\u2019s power.",
                "Which do you choose?",
                "Should I come with a rod to punish you, or should I come with love and a gentle spirit? \n\n",
                "I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you\u2014something that even pagans don\u2019t do.",
                "I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother.",
                "You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame.",
                "And you should remove this man from your fellowship.",
                "Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit.",
                "And as though I were there, I have already passed judgment on this man in the name of the Lord Jesus.",
                "You must call a meeting of the church.",
                "I will be present with you in spirit, and so will the power of our Lord Jesus.",
                "Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed and he himself will be saved on the day the Lord returns.",
                "Your boasting about this is terrible.",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough?",
                "Get rid of the old \u201cyeast\u201d by removing this wicked person from among you.",
                "Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are.",
                "Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.",
                "So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread of sincerity and truth.",
                "When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin.",
                "But I wasn\u2019t talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols.",
                "You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that.",
                "I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people.",
                "Don\u2019t even eat with such people.",
                "It isn\u2019t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning.",
                "God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, \u201cYou must remove the evil person from among you.\u201d \n\n",
                "When one of you has a dispute with another believer, how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers!",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that someday we believers will judge the world?",
                "And since you are going to judge the world, can\u2019t you decide even these little things among yourselves?",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that we will judge angels?",
                "So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life.",
                "If you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church?",
                "I am saying this to shame you.",
                "Isn\u2019t there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues?",
                "But instead, one believer sues another\u2014right in front of unbelievers!",
                "Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you.",
                "Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that?",
                "Why not let yourselves be cheated?",
                "Instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers.",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God?",
                "Don\u2019t fool yourselves.",
                "Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people\u2014none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God.",
                "Some of you were once like that.",
                "But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.",
                "You say, \u201cI am allowed to do anything\u201d\u2014but not everything is good for you.",
                "And even though \u201cI am allowed to do anything,\u201d I must not become a slave to anything.",

                "They were made for the Lord, and the Lord cares about our bodies.",
                "And God will raise us from the dead by his power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead.",
                "Don\u2019t you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ?",
                "Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ, and join it to a prostitute?",
                "Never!",
                "And don\u2019t you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her?",

                "And isn\u2019t long hair a woman\u2019s pride and joy?",
                "For it has been given to her as a covering.",

                "When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord\u2019s Supper.",
                "For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others.",
                "As a result, some go hungry while others get drunk.",
                "What?",
                "Don\u2019t you have your own homes for eating and drinking?",
                "Or do you really want to disgrace God\u2019s church and shame the poor?",
                "What am I supposed to say?",

                "For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honoring the body of Christ, you are eating and drinking God\u2019s judgment upon yourself.",
                "That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died.",
                "But if we would examine ourselves, we would not be judged by God in this way.",

                "God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us.",
                "A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.",
                "To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same Spirit gives a message of special knowledge.",
                "The same Spirit gives great faith to another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing.",
                "He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy.",
                "He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit.",
                "Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages, while another is given the ability to interpret what is being said.",

                "If the foot says, \u201cI am not a part of the body because I am not a hand,\u201d that does not make it any less a part of the body.",

                "Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything?",

                "So we carefully protect those parts that should not be seen, while the more honorable parts do not require this special care.",
                "So God has put the body together such that extra honor and care are given to those parts that have less dignity.",

                "If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God\u2019s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn\u2019t love others, I would be nothing.",
                "If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn\u2019t love others, I would have gained nothing.",
                "Love is patient and kind.",
                "Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude.",

                "It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.",
                "Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.",
                "Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge will become useless.",
                "But love will last forever!",
                "Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture!",
                "But when the time of perfection comes, these partial things will become useless.",
                "When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child.",
                "But when I grew up, I put away childish things.",
                "Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity.",
                "All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.",
                "Three things will last forever\u2014faith, hope, and love\u2014and the greatest of these is love. \n\n",
                "Let love be your highest goal!",
                "But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives\u2014especially the ability to prophesy.",
                "For if you have the ability to speak in tongues, you will be talking only to God, since people won\u2019t be able to understand you.",
                "You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit, but it will all be mysterious.",
                "But one who prophesies strengthens others, encourages them, and comforts them.",
                "A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally, but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church.",
                "I wish you could all speak in tongues, but even more I wish you could all prophesy.",
                "For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues, unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church will be strengthened.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, if I should come to you speaking in an unknown language, how would that help you?",
                "But if I bring you a revelation or some special knowledge or prophecy or teaching, that will be helpful.",
                "Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognize the melody.",
                "And if the bugler doesn\u2019t sound a clear call, how will the soldiers know they are being called to battle?",
                "It\u2019s the same for you.",
                "If you speak to people in words they don\u2019t understand, how will they know what you are saying?",
                "You might as well be talking into empty space.",
                "There are many different languages in the world, and every language has meaning.",
                "But if I don\u2019t understand a language, I will be a foreigner to someone who speaks it, and the one who speaks it will be a foreigner to me.",
                "And the same is true for you.",
                "Since you are so eager to have the special abilities the Spirit gives, seek those that will strengthen the whole church.",
                "So anyone who speaks in tongues should pray also for the ability to interpret what has been said.",
                "For if I pray in tongues, my spirit is praying, but I don\u2019t understand what I am saying.",
                "Well then, what shall I do?",
                "I will pray in the spirit, and I will also pray in words I understand.",
                "I will sing in the spirit, and I will also sing in words I understand.",
                "For if you praise God only in the spirit, how can those who don\u2019t understand you praise God along with you?",
                "How can they join you in giving thanks when they don\u2019t understand what you are saying?",
                "You will be giving thanks very well, but it won\u2019t strengthen the people who hear you.",
                "I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you.",
                "But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, don\u2019t be childish in your understanding of these things.",
                "Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil, but be mature in understanding matters of this kind.",
                "It is written in the Scriptures: \u201cI will speak to my own people through strange languages and through the lips of foreigners.",
                "But even then, they will not listen to me,\u201d says the Lord.",
                "So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers.",
                "Prophecy, however, is for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers.",
                "Even so, if unbelievers or people who don\u2019t understand these things come into your church meeting and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language, they will think you are crazy.",
                "But if all of you are prophesying, and unbelievers or people who don\u2019t understand these things come into your meeting, they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say.",
                "As they listen, their secret thoughts will be exposed, and they will fall to their knees and worship God, declaring, \u201cGod is truly here among you.\u201d",
                "Well, my brothers and sisters, let\u2019s summarize.",
                "When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said.",
                "But everything that is done must strengthen all of you.",
                "No more than two or three should speak in tongues.",
                "They must speak one at a time, and someone must interpret what they say.",
                "But if no one is present who can interpret, they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately.",
                "Let two or three people prophesy, and let the others evaluate what is said.",
                "But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord, the one who is speaking must stop.",
                "In this way, all who prophesy will have a turn to speak, one after the other, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged.",
                "Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can take turns.",
                "For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God\u2019s holy people.",
                "Women should be silent during the church meetings.",
                "It is not proper for them to speak.",
                "They should be submissive, just as the law says.",
                "If they have any questions, they should ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings.",
                "Or do you think God\u2019s word originated with you Corinthians?",
                "Are you the only ones to whom it was given?",
                "If you claim to be a prophet or think you are spiritual, you should recognize that what I am saying is a command from the Lord himself.",
                "But if you do not recognize this, you yourself will not be recognized.",
                "So, my dear brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and don\u2019t forbid speaking in tongues.",
                "But be sure that everything is done properly and in order. \n\n",
                "Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before.",
                "You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it.",
                "It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you\u2014unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place.",
                "I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me.",
                "Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said.",
                "He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.",
                "He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve.",
                "After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.",
                "Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles.",
                "Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him.",
                "For I am the least of all the apostles.",
                "In fact, I\u2019m not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God\u2019s church.",
                "But whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favor on me\u2014and not without results.",
                "For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace.",
                "So it makes no difference whether I preach or they preach, for we all preach the same message you have already believed.",
                "But tell me this\u2014since we preach that Christ rose from the dead, why are some of you saying there will be no resurrection of the dead?",
                "For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either.",
                "And if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless.",
                "And we apostles would all be lying about God\u2014for we have said that God raised Christ from the grave.",
                "But that can\u2019t be true if there is no resurrection of the dead.",
                "And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.",
                "And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins.",
                "In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost!",
                "And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world.",
                "But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.",
                "He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died.",
                "So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man.",
                "Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam, everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life.",
                "But there is an order to this resurrection: Christ was raised as the first of the harvest; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back.",
                "After that the end will come, when he will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having destroyed every ruler and authority and power.",
                "For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet.",
                "And the last enemy to be destroyed is death.",
                "For the Scriptures say, \u201cGod has put all things under his authority.\u201d",
                "(Of course, when it says \u201call things are under his authority,\u201d that does not include God himself, who gave Christ his authority.)",
                "Then, when all things are under his authority, the Son will put himself under God\u2019s authority, so that God, who gave his Son authority over all things, will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere.",
                "If the dead will not be raised, what point is there in people being baptized for those who are dead?",
                "Why do it unless the dead will someday rise again?",
                "And why should we ourselves risk our lives hour by hour?",
                "For I swear, dear brothers and sisters, that I face death daily.",
                "This is as certain as my pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done in you.",
                "And what value was there in fighting wild beasts\u2014those people of Ephesus\u2014if there will be no resurrection from the dead?",
                "And if there is no resurrection, \u201cLet\u2019s feast and drink, for tomorrow we die!\u201d",
                "Don\u2019t be fooled by those who say such things, for \u201cbad company corrupts good character.\u201d",
                "Think carefully about what is right, and stop sinning.",
                "For to your shame I say that some of you don\u2019t know God at all.",
                "But someone may ask, \u201cHow will the dead be raised?",
                "What kind of bodies will they have?\u201d",
                "What a foolish question!",
                "When you put a seed into the ground, it doesn\u2019t grow into a plant unless it dies first.",

                "Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have.",
                "A different plant grows from each kind of seed.",

        "2 Corinthians": {
            "text": "This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy. I am writing to God\u2019s church in Corinth and to all of his holy people throughout Greece. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is our merciful Father and the source of all comfort. He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us. For the more we suffer for Christ, the more God will shower us with his comfort through Christ. Even when we are weighed down with troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation! For when we ourselves are comforted, we will certainly comfort you. Then you can patiently endure the same things we suffer. We are confident that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in the comfort God gives us. We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it. In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead. And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us. And you are helping us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks because God has graciously answered so many prayers for our safety. We can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have lived with a God-given holiness and sincerity in all our dealings. We have depended on God\u2019s grace, not on our own human wisdom. That is how we have conducted ourselves before the world, and especially toward you. Our letters have been straightforward, and there is nothing written between the lines and nothing you can\u2019t understand. I hope someday you will fully understand us, even if you don\u2019t understand us now. Then on the day when the Lord Jesus returns, you will be proud of us in the same way we are proud of you. Since I was so sure of your understanding and trust, I wanted to give you a double blessing by visiting you twice\u2014 first on my way to Macedonia and again when I returned from Macedonia. Then you could send me on my way to Judea. You may be asking why I changed my plan. Do you think I make my plans carelessly? Do you think I am like people of the world who say \u201cYes\u201d when they really mean \u201cNo\u201d? As surely as God is faithful, our word to you does not waver between \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, does not waver between \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d He is the one whom Silas, Timothy, and I preached to you, and as God\u2019s ultimate \u201cYes,\u201d he always does what he says. For all of God\u2019s promises have been fulfilled in Christ with a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d And through Christ, our \u201cAmen\u201d (which means \u201cYes\u201d) ascends to God for his glory. It is God who enables us, along with you, to stand firm for Christ. He has commissioned us, and he has identified us as his own by placing the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the first installment that guarantees everything he has promised us. Now I call upon God as my witness that I am telling the truth. The reason I didn\u2019t return to Corinth was to spare you from a severe rebuke. But that does not mean we want to dominate you by telling you how to put your faith into practice. We want to work together with you so you will be full of joy, for it is by your own faith that you stand firm. \n\nSo I decided that I would not bring you grief with another painful visit. For if I cause you grief, who will make me glad? Certainly not someone I have grieved. That is why I wrote to you as I did, so that when I do come, I won\u2019t be grieved by the very ones who ought to give me the greatest joy. Surely you all know that my joy comes from your being joyful. I wrote that letter in great anguish, with a troubled heart and many tears. I didn\u2019t want to grieve you, but I wanted to let you know how much love I have for you. I am not overstating it when I say that the man who caused all the trouble hurt all of you more than he hurt me. Most of you opposed him, and that was punishment enough. Now, however, it is time to forgive and comfort him. Otherwise he may be overcome by discouragement. So I urge you now to reaffirm your love for him. I wrote to you as I did to test you and see if you would fully comply with my instructions. When you forgive this man, I forgive him, too. And when I forgive whatever needs to be forgiven, I do so with Christ\u2019s authority for your benefit, so that Satan will not outsmart us. For we are familiar with his evil schemes. When I came to the city of Troas to preach the Good News of Christ, the Lord opened a door of opportunity for me. But I had no peace of mind because my dear brother Titus hadn\u2019t yet arrived with a report from you. So I said good-bye and went on to Macedonia to find him. But thank God! He has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in Christ\u2019s triumphal procession. Now he uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere, like a sweet perfume. Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing. To those who are perishing, we are a dreadful smell of death and doom. But to those who are being saved, we are a life-giving perfume. And who is adequate for such a task as this? You see, we are not like the many hucksters who preach for personal profit. We preach the word of God with sincerity and with Christ\u2019s authority, knowing that God is watching us. \n\nAre we beginning to praise ourselves again? Are we like others, who need to bring you letters of recommendation, or who ask you to write such letters on their behalf? Surely not! The only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves. Your lives are a letter written in our hearts; everyone can read it and recognize our good work among you. Clearly, you are a letter from Christ showing the result of our ministry among you. This \u201cletter\u201d is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is carved not on tablets of stone, but on human hearts. We are confident of all this because of our great trust in God through Christ. It is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own. Our qualification comes from God. He has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant. This is a covenant not of written laws, but of the Spirit. The old written covenant ends in death; but under the new covenant, the Spirit gives life. The old way, with laws etched in stone, led to death, though it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses\u2019 face. For his face shone with the glory of God, even though the brightness was already fading away. Shouldn\u2019t we expect far greater glory under the new way, now that the Holy Spirit is giving life? If the old way, which brings condemnation, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new way, which makes us right with God! In fact, that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way. So if the old way, which has been replaced, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new, which remains forever! Since this new way gives us such confidence, we can be very bold. We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel would not see the glory, even though it was destined to fade away. But the people\u2019s minds were hardened, and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ. Yes, even today when they read Moses\u2019 writings, their hearts are covered with that veil, and they do not understand. But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord\u2014who is the Spirit\u2014makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image. \n\nTherefore, since God in his mercy has given us this new way, we never give up. We reject all shameful deeds and underhanded methods. We don\u2019t try to trick anyone or distort the word of God. We tell the truth before God, and all who are honest know this. If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only from people who are perishing. Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don\u2019t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don\u2019t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God. You see, we don\u2019t go around preaching about ourselves. We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we ourselves are your servants for Jesus\u2019 sake. For God, who said, \u201cLet there be light in the darkness,\u201d has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ. We now have this light shining in our hearts, but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure. This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves. We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair. We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed. Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies. Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies. So we live in the face of death, but this has resulted in eternal life for you. But we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said, \u201cI believed in God, so I spoke.\u201d We know that God, who raised the Lord Jesus, will also raise us with Jesus and present us to himself together with you. All of this is for your benefit. And as God\u2019s grace reaches more and more people, there will be great thanksgiving, and God will receive more and more glory. That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day. For our present troubles are small and won\u2019t last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever! So we don\u2019t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever. \n\nFor we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God himself and not by human hands. We grow weary in our present bodies, and we long to put on our heavenly bodies like new clothing. For we will put on heavenly bodies; we will not be spirits without bodies. While we live in these earthly bodies, we groan and sigh, but it\u2019s not that we want to die and get rid of these bodies that clothe us. Rather, we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life. God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit. So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord. For we live by believing and not by seeing. Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the Lord. So whether we are here in this body or away from this body, our goal is to please him. For we must all stand before Christ to be judged. We will each receive whatever we deserve for the good or evil we have done in this earthly body. Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others. God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too. Are we commending ourselves to you again? No, we are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so you can answer those who brag about having a spectacular ministry rather than having a sincere heart. If it seems we are crazy, it is to bring glory to God. And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. Either way, Christ\u2019s love controls us. Since we believe that Christ died for all, we also believe that we have all died to our old life. He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them. So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun! And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people\u2019s sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. So we are Christ\u2019s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, \u201cCome back to God!\u201d For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ. \n\nAs God\u2019s partners, we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God\u2019s kindness and then ignore it. For God says, \u201cAt just the right time, I heard you. On the day of salvation, I helped you.\u201d Indeed, the \u201cright time\u201d is now. Today is the day of salvation. We live in such a way that no one will stumble because of us, and no one will find fault with our ministry. In everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God. We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind. We have been beaten, been put in prison, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food. We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding, our patience, our kindness, by the Holy Spirit within us, and by our sincere love. We faithfully preach the truth. God\u2019s power is working in us. We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense. We serve God whether people honor us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us. We are honest, but they call us impostors. We are ignored, even though we are well known. We live close to death, but we are still alive. We have been beaten, but we have not been killed. Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything. Oh, dear Corinthian friends! We have spoken honestly with you, and our hearts are open to you. There is no lack of love on our part, but you have withheld your love from us. I am asking you to respond as if you were my own children. Open your hearts to us! Don\u2019t team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever? And what union can there be between God\u2019s temple and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God said: \u201cI will live in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people. Therefore, come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord. Don\u2019t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you. And I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.\u201d \n\nBecause we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit. And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God. Please open your hearts to us. We have not done wrong to anyone, nor led anyone astray, nor taken advantage of anyone. I\u2019m not saying this to condemn you. I said before that you are in our hearts, and we live or die together with you. I have the highest confidence in you, and I take great pride in you. You have greatly encouraged me and made me happy despite all our troubles. When we arrived in Macedonia, there was no rest for us. We faced conflict from every direction, with battles on the outside and fear on the inside. But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus. His presence was a joy, but so was the news he brought of the encouragement he received from you. When he told us how much you long to see me, and how sorry you are for what happened, and how loyal you are to me, I was filled with joy! I am not sorry that I sent that severe letter to you, though I was sorry at first, for I know it was painful to you for a little while. Now I am glad I sent it, not because it hurt you, but because the pain caused you to repent and change your ways. It was the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have, so you were not harmed by us in any way. For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation. There\u2019s no regret for that kind of sorrow. But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death. Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you! Such earnestness, such concern to clear yourselves, such indignation, such alarm, such longing to see me, such zeal, and such a readiness to punish wrong. You showed that you have done everything necessary to make things right. My purpose, then, was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged. I wrote to you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how loyal you are to us. We have been greatly encouraged by this. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was about the way all of you welcomed him and set his mind at ease. I had told him how proud I was of you\u2014and you didn\u2019t disappoint me. I have always told you the truth, and now my boasting to Titus has also proved true! Now he cares for you more than ever when he remembers the way all of you obeyed him and welcomed him with such fear and deep respect. I am very happy now because I have complete confidence in you. \n\nNow I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters, what God in his kindness has done through the churches in Macedonia. They are being tested by many troubles, and they are very poor. But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity. For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more. And they did it of their own free will. They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers in Jerusalem. They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do. So we have urged Titus, who encouraged your giving in the first place, to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving. Since you excel in so many ways\u2014in your faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love from us\u2014I want you to excel also in this gracious act of giving. I am not commanding you to do this. But I am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the other churches. You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich. Here is my advice: It would be good for you to finish what you started a year ago. Last year you were the first who wanted to give, and you were the first to begin doing it. Now you should finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now by your giving. Give in proportion to what you have. Whatever you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly. And give according to what you have, not what you don\u2019t have. Of course, I don\u2019t mean your giving should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves. I only mean that there should be some equality. Right now you have plenty and can help those who are in need. Later, they will have plenty and can share with you when you need it. In this way, things will be equal. As the Scriptures say, \u201cThose who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered only a little had enough.\u201d But thank God! He has given Titus the same enthusiasm for you that I have. Titus welcomed our request that he visit you again. In fact, he himself was very eager to go and see you. We are also sending another brother with Titus. All the churches praise him as a preacher of the Good News. He was appointed by the churches to accompany us as we take the offering to Jerusalem\u2014a service that glorifies the Lord and shows our eagerness to help. We are traveling together to guard against any criticism for the way we are handling this generous gift. We are careful to be honorable before the Lord, but we also want everyone else to see that we are honorable. We are also sending with them another of our brothers who has proven himself many times and has shown on many occasions how eager he is. He is now even more enthusiastic because of his great confidence in you. If anyone asks about Titus, say that he is my partner who works with me to help you. And the brothers with him have been sent by the churches, and they bring honor to Christ. So show them your love, and prove to all the churches that our boasting about you is justified. \n\nI really don\u2019t need to write to you about this ministry of giving for the believers in Jerusalem. For I know how eager you are to help, and I have been boasting to the churches in Macedonia that you in Greece were ready to send an offering a year ago. In fact, it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving. But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected. I don\u2019t want to be wrong in my boasting about you. We would be embarrassed\u2014not to mention your own embarrassment\u2014if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you weren\u2019t ready after all I had told them! So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready. But I want it to be a willing gift, not one given grudgingly. Remember this\u2014a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop. You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don\u2019t give reluctantly or in response to pressure. \u201cFor God loves a person who gives cheerfully.\u201d And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others. As the Scriptures say, \u201cThey share freely and give generously to the poor. Their good deeds will be remembered forever.\u201d For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you. Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God. So two good things will result from this ministry of giving\u2014the needs of the believers in Jerusalem will be met, and they will joyfully express their thanks to God. As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ. And they will pray for you with deep affection because of the overflowing grace God has given to you. Thank God for this gift too wonderful for words! \n\nNow I, Paul, appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ\u2014though I realize you think I am timid in person and bold only when I write from far away. Well, I am begging you now so that when I come I won\u2019t have to be bold with those who think we act from human motives. We are human, but we don\u2019t wage war as humans do. We use God\u2019s mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments. We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God. We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ. And after you have become fully obedient, we will punish everyone who remains disobedient. Look at the obvious facts. Those who say they belong to Christ must recognize that we belong to Christ as much as they do. I may seem to be boasting too much about the authority given to us by the Lord. But our authority builds you up; it doesn\u2019t tear you down. So I will not be ashamed of using my authority. I\u2019m not trying to frighten you by my letters. For some say, \u201cPaul\u2019s letters are demanding and forceful, but in person he is weak, and his speeches are worthless!\u201d Those people should realize that our actions when we arrive in person will be as forceful as what we say in our letters from far away. Oh, don\u2019t worry; we wouldn\u2019t dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are! But they are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant! We will not boast about things done outside our area of authority. We will boast only about what has happened within the boundaries of the work God has given us, which includes our working with you. We are not reaching beyond these boundaries when we claim authority over you, as if we had never visited you. For we were the first to travel all the way to Corinth with the Good News of Christ. Nor do we boast and claim credit for the work someone else has done. Instead, we hope that your faith will grow so that the boundaries of our work among you will be extended. Then we will be able to go and preach the Good News in other places far beyond you, where no one else is working. Then there will be no question of our boasting about work done in someone else\u2019s territory. As the Scriptures say, \u201cIf you want to boast, boast only about the Lord.\u201d When people commend themselves, it doesn\u2019t count for much. The important thing is for the Lord to commend them. \n\nI hope you will put up with a little more of my foolishness. Please bear with me. For I am jealous for you with the jealousy of God himself. I promised you as a pure bride to one husband\u2014Christ. But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted, just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent. You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you, even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach, or a different kind of Spirit than the one you received, or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed. But I don\u2019t consider myself inferior in any way to these \u201csuper apostles\u201d who teach such things. I may be unskilled as a speaker, but I\u2019m not lacking in knowledge. We have made this clear to you in every possible way. Was I wrong when I humbled myself and honored you by preaching God\u2019s Good News to you without expecting anything in return? I \u201crobbed\u201d other churches by accepting their contributions so I could serve you at no cost. And when I was with you and didn\u2019t have enough to live on, I did not become a financial burden to anyone. For the brothers who came from Macedonia brought me all that I needed. I have never been a burden to you, and I never will be. As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, no one in all of Greece will ever stop me from boasting about this. Why? Because I don\u2019t love you? God knows that I do. But I will continue doing what I have always done. This will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours. These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ. But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve. Again I say, don\u2019t think that I am a fool to talk like this. But even if you do, listen to me, as you would to a foolish person, while I also boast a little. Such boasting is not from the Lord, but I am acting like a fool. And since others boast about their human achievements, I will, too. After all, you think you are so wise, but you enjoy putting up with fools! You put up with it when someone enslaves you, takes everything you have, takes advantage of you, takes control of everything, and slaps you in the face. I\u2019m ashamed to say that we\u2019ve been too \u201cweak\u201d to do that! But whatever they dare to boast about\u2014I\u2019m talking like a fool again\u2014I dare to boast about it, too. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? I know I sound like a madman, but I have served him far more! I have worked harder, been put in prison more often, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again. Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not. I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm. Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my feeling that weakness? Who is led astray, and I do not burn with anger? If I must boast, I would rather boast about the things that show how weak I am. God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, who is worthy of eternal praise, knows I am not lying. When I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas kept guards at the city gates to catch me. I had to be lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall to escape from him. \n\nThis boasting will do no good, but I must go on. I will reluctantly tell about visions and revelations from the Lord. I was caught up to the third heaven fourteen years ago. Whether I was in my body or out of my body, I don\u2019t know\u2014only God knows. Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I do know that I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell. That experience is worth boasting about, but I\u2019m not going to do it. I will boast only about my weaknesses. If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth. But I won\u2019t do it, because I don\u2019t want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message, even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud. Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. Each time he said, \u201cMy grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.\u201d So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. That\u2019s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong. You have made me act like a fool. You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these \u201csuper apostles,\u201d even though I am nothing at all. When I was with you, I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle. For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you. The only thing I failed to do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a financial burden to you. Please forgive me for this wrong! Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don\u2019t want what you have\u2014I want you. After all, children don\u2019t provide for their parents. Rather, parents provide for their children. I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me. Some of you admit I was not a burden to you. But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery. But how? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you? When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you? No! For we have the same spirit and walk in each other\u2019s steps, doing things the same way. Perhaps you think we\u2019re saying these things just to defend ourselves. No, we tell you this as Christ\u2019s servants, and with God as our witness. Everything we do, dear friends, is to strengthen you. For I am afraid that when I come I won\u2019t like what I find, and you won\u2019t like my response. I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly behavior. Yes, I am afraid that when I come again, God will humble me in your presence. And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins. You have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure. \n\nThis is the third time I am coming to visit you (and as the Scriptures say, \u201cThe facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses\u201d). I have already warned those who had been sinning when I was there on my second visit. Now I again warn them and all others, just as I did before, that next time I will not spare them. I will give you all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me. Christ is not weak when he deals with you; he is powerful among you. Although he was crucified in weakness, he now lives by the power of God. We, too, are weak, just as Christ was, but when we deal with you we will be alive with him and will have God\u2019s power. Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. As you test yourselves, I hope you will recognize that we have not failed the test of apostolic authority. We pray to God that you will not do what is wrong by refusing our correction. I hope we won\u2019t need to demonstrate our authority when we arrive. Do the right thing before we come\u2014even if that makes it look like we have failed to demonstrate our authority. For we cannot oppose the truth, but must always stand for the truth. We are glad to seem weak if it helps show that you are actually strong. We pray that you will become mature. I am writing this to you before I come, hoping that I won\u2019t need to deal severely with you when I do come. For I want to use the authority the Lord has given me to strengthen you, not to tear you down. Dear brothers and sisters, I close my letter with these last words: Be joyful. Grow to maturity. Encourage each other. Live in harmony and peace. Then the God of love and peace will be with you. Greet each other with a sacred kiss. All of God\u2019s people here send you their greetings. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. \n\n",

                "This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves.",
                "We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed.",
                "We are perplexed, but not driven to despair.",
                "We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God.",
                "We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed.",
                "Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies.",
                "Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies.",
                "So we live in the face of death, but this has resulted in eternal life for you.",
                "But we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said, \u201cI believed in God, so I spoke.\u201d",
                "We know that God, who raised the Lord Jesus, will also raise us with Jesus and present us to himself together with you.",
                "All of this is for your benefit.",
                "And as God\u2019s grace reaches more and more people, there will be great thanksgiving, and God will receive more and more glory.",
                "That is why we never give up.",
                "Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day.",
                "For our present troubles are small and won\u2019t last very long.",
                "Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever!",
                "So we don\u2019t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen.",
                "For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever. \n\n",
                "For we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God himself and not by human hands.",
                "We grow weary in our present bodies, and we long to put on our heavenly bodies like new clothing.",
                "For we will put on heavenly bodies; we will not be spirits without bodies.",
                "While we live in these earthly bodies, we groan and sigh, but it\u2019s not that we want to die and get rid of these bodies that clothe us.",
                "Rather, we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life.",
                "God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit.",
                "So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord.",
                "For we live by believing and not by seeing.",
                "Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the Lord.",
                "So whether we are here in this body or away from this body, our goal is to please him.",
                "For we must all stand before Christ to be judged.",
                "We will each receive whatever we deserve for the good or evil we have done in this earthly body.",
                "Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others.",
                "God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too.",
                "Are we commending ourselves to you again?",
                "No, we are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so you can answer those who brag about having a spectacular ministry rather than having a sincere heart.",
                "If it seems we are crazy, it is to bring glory to God.",
                "And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit.",
                "Either way, Christ\u2019s love controls us.",
                "Since we believe that Christ died for all, we also believe that we have all died to our old life.",
                "He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves.",
                "Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them.",
                "So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view.",
                "At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view.",
                "How differently we know him now!",
                "This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person.",
                "The old life is gone; a new life has begun!",
                "And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ.",
                "And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him.",
                "For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people\u2019s sins against them.",
                "And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation.",
                "So we are Christ\u2019s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us.",
                "We speak for Christ when we plead, \u201cCome back to God!\u201d",
                "For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ. \n\n",
                "As God\u2019s partners, we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God\u2019s kindness and then ignore it.",
                "For God says, \u201cAt just the right time, I heard you.",
                "On the day of salvation, I helped you.\u201d",
                "Indeed, the \u201cright time\u201d is now.",
                "Today is the day of salvation.",
                "We live in such a way that no one will stumble because of us, and no one will find fault with our ministry.",
                "In everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God.",
                "We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind.",
                "We have been beaten, been put in prison, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food.",
                "We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding, our patience, our kindness, by the Holy Spirit within us, and by our sincere love.",
                "We faithfully preach the truth.",
                "God\u2019s power is working in us.",
                "We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense.",
                "We serve God whether people honor us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us.",
                "We are honest, but they call us impostors.",
                "We are ignored, even though we are well known.",
                "We live close to death, but we are still alive.",
                "We have been beaten, but we have not been killed.",
                "Our hearts ache, but we always have joy.",
                "We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others.",
                "We own nothing, and yet we have everything.",
                "Oh, dear Corinthian friends!",
                "We have spoken honestly with you, and our hearts are open to you.",
                "There is no lack of love on our part, but you have withheld your love from us.",
                "I am asking you to respond as if you were my own children.",
                "Open your hearts to us!",
                "Don\u2019t team up with those who are unbelievers.",
                "How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness?",
                "How can light live with darkness?",
                "What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil?",
                "How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?",
                "And what union can there be between God\u2019s temple and idols?",
                "For we are the temple of the living God.",
                "As God said: \u201cI will live in them and walk among them.",
                "I will be their God, and they will be my people.",
                "Therefore, come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord.",
                "Don\u2019t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you.",
                "And I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.\u201d \n\nBecause we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit.",
                "And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God.",
                "Please open your hearts to us.",
                "We have not done wrong to anyone, nor led anyone astray, nor taken advantage of anyone.",
                "I\u2019m not saying this to condemn you.",
                "I said before that you are in our hearts, and we live or die together with you.",
                "I have the highest confidence in you, and I take great pride in you.",
                "You have greatly encouraged me and made me happy despite all our troubles.",
                "When we arrived in Macedonia, there was no rest for us.",
                "We faced conflict from every direction, with battles on the outside and fear on the inside.",
                "But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.",
                "His presence was a joy, but so was the news he brought of the encouragement he received from you.",
                "When he told us how much you long to see me, and how sorry you are for what happened, and how loyal you are to me, I was filled with joy!",
                "I am not sorry that I sent that severe letter to you, though I was sorry at first, for I know it was painful to you for a little while.",
                "Now I am glad I sent it, not because it hurt you, but because the pain caused you to repent and change your ways.",
                "It was the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have, so you were not harmed by us in any way.",
                "For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation.",
                "There\u2019s no regret for that kind of sorrow.",
                "But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death.",
                "Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you!",
                "Such earnestness, such concern to clear yourselves, such indignation, such alarm, such longing to see me, such zeal, and such a readiness to punish wrong.",
                "You showed that you have done everything necessary to make things right.",
                "My purpose, then, was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged.",
                "I wrote to you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how loyal you are to us.",
                "We have been greatly encouraged by this.",
                "In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was about the way all of you welcomed him and set his mind at ease.",
                "I had told him how proud I was of you\u2014and you didn\u2019t disappoint me.",
                "I have always told you the truth, and now my boasting to Titus has also proved true!",
                "Now he cares for you more than ever when he remembers the way all of you obeyed him and welcomed him with such fear and deep respect.",
                "I am very happy now because I have complete confidence in you. \n\n",
                "Now I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters, what God in his kindness has done through the churches in Macedonia.",
                "They are being tested by many troubles, and they are very poor.",
                "But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity.",
                "For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more.",
                "And they did it of their own free will.",
                "They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers in Jerusalem.",
                "They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do.",
                "So we have urged Titus, who encouraged your giving in the first place, to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving.",
                "Since you excel in so many ways\u2014in your faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love from us\u2014I want you to excel also in this gracious act of giving.",
                "I am not commanding you to do this.",
                "But I am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the other churches.",
                "You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
                "Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich.",
                "Here is my advice: It would be good for you to finish what you started a year ago.",
                "Last year you were the first who wanted to give, and you were the first to begin doing it.",
                "Now you should finish what you started.",
                "Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now by your giving.",
                "Give in proportion to what you have.",
                "Whatever you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly.",
                "And give according to what you have, not what you don\u2019t have.",
                "Of course, I don\u2019t mean your giving should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves.",
                "I only mean that there should be some equality.",
                "Right now you have plenty and can help those who are in need.",
                "Later, they will have plenty and can share with you when you need it.",
                "In this way, things will be equal.",
                "As the Scriptures say, \u201cThose who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered only a little had enough.\u201d",
                "But thank God!",
                "He has given Titus the same enthusiasm for you that I have.",
                "Titus welcomed our request that he visit you again.",
                "In fact, he himself was very eager to go and see you.",
                "We are also sending another brother with Titus.",
                "All the churches praise him as a preacher of the Good News.",
                "He was appointed by the churches to accompany us as we take the offering to Jerusalem\u2014a service that glorifies the Lord and shows our eagerness to help.",
                "We are traveling together to guard against any criticism for the way we are handling this generous gift.",
                "We are careful to be honorable before the Lord, but we also want everyone else to see that we are honorable.",
                "We are also sending with them another of our brothers who has proven himself many times and has shown on many occasions how eager he is.",
                "He is now even more enthusiastic because of his great confidence in you.",
                "If anyone asks about Titus, say that he is my partner who works with me to help you.",
                "And the brothers with him have been sent by the churches, and they bring honor to Christ.",
                "So show them your love, and prove to all the churches that our boasting about you is justified. \n\n",
                "I really don\u2019t need to write to you about this ministry of giving for the believers in Jerusalem.",
                "For I know how eager you are to help, and I have been boasting to the churches in Macedonia that you in Greece were ready to send an offering a year ago.",
                "In fact, it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving.",
                "But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected.",
                "I don\u2019t want to be wrong in my boasting about you.",
                "We would be embarrassed\u2014not to mention your own embarrassment\u2014if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you weren\u2019t ready after all I had told them!",
                "So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready.",
                "But I want it to be a willing gift, not one given grudgingly.",
                "Remember this\u2014a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop.",
                "But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop.",
                "You must each decide in your heart how much to give.",
                "And don\u2019t give reluctantly or in response to pressure.",
                "\u201cFor God loves a person who gives cheerfully.\u201d",
                "And God will generously provide all you need.",
                "Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.",

                "Their good deeds will be remembered forever.\u201d",
                "For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat.",
                "In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you.",
                "Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous.",
                "And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God.",
                "So two good things will result from this ministry of giving\u2014the needs of the believers in Jerusalem will be met, and they will joyfully express their thanks to God.",
                "As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God.",
                "For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ.",
                "And they will pray for you with deep affection because of the overflowing grace God has given to you.",
                "Thank God for this gift too wonderful for words! \n\n",
                "Now I, Paul, appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ\u2014though I realize you think I am timid in person and bold only when I write from far away.",
                "Well, I am begging you now so that when I come I won\u2019t have to be bold with those who think we act from human motives.",
                "We are human, but we don\u2019t wage war as humans do.",

                "I promised you as a pure bride to one husband\u2014Christ.",
                "But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted, just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent.",
                "You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you, even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach, or a different kind of Spirit than the one you received, or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed.",
                "But I don\u2019t consider myself inferior in any way to these \u201csuper apostles\u201d who teach such things.",
                "I may be unskilled as a speaker, but I\u2019m not lacking in knowledge.",
                "We have made this clear to you in every possible way.",
                "Was I wrong when I humbled myself and honored you by preaching God\u2019s Good News to you without expecting anything in return?",
                "I \u201crobbed\u201d other churches by accepting their contributions",
                "so I could serve you at no cost.",
                "And when I was with you and didn\u2019t have enough to live on, I did not become a financial burden to anyone.",
                "For the brothers who came from Macedonia brought me all that I needed.",
                "I have never been a burden to you, and I never will be.",
                "As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, no one in all of Greece will ever stop me from boasting about this.",
                "Why?",
                "Because I don\u2019t love you?",
                "God knows that I do.",
                "But I will continue doing what I have always done.",
                "This will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours.",
                "These people are false apostles.",
                "They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ.",
                "But I am not surprised!",
                "Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.",
                "So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness.",
                "In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve.",
                "Again I say, don\u2019t think that I am a fool to talk like this.",
                "But even if you do, listen to me, as you would to a foolish person, while I also boast a little.",
                "Such boasting is not from the Lord, but I am acting like a fool.",
                "And since others boast about their human achievements, I will, too.",
                "After all, you think you are so wise, but you enjoy putting up with fools!",
                "You put up with it when someone enslaves you, takes everything you have, takes advantage of you, takes control of everything, and slaps you in the face.",
                "I\u2019m ashamed to say that we\u2019ve been too \u201cweak\u201d to do that!",
                "But whatever they dare to boast about\u2014I\u2019m talking like a fool again\u2014I dare to boast about it, too.",
                "Are they Hebrews?",
                "So am I. Are they Israelites?",
                "So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham?",
                "So am I. Are they servants of Christ?",
                "I know I sound like a madman, but I have served him far more!",
                "I have worked harder, been put in prison more often, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again.",
                "Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes.",
                "Three times I was beaten with rods.",
                "Once I was stoned.",
                "Three times I was shipwrecked.",
                "Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea.",
                "I have traveled on many long journeys.",
                "I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers.",
                "I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles.",
                "I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas.",
                "And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not.",
                "I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights.",
                "I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food.",
                "I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm.",
                "Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches.",
                "Who is weak without my feeling that weakness?",
                "Who is led astray, and I do not burn with anger?",
                "If I must boast, I would rather boast about the things that show how weak I am.",
                "God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, who is worthy of eternal praise, knows I am not lying.",
                "When I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas kept guards at the city gates to catch me.",
                "I had to be lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall to escape from him. \n\n",
                "This boasting will do no good, but I must go on.",
                "I will reluctantly tell about visions and revelations from the Lord.",
                "I was caught up to the third heaven fourteen years ago.",
                "Whether I was in my body or out of my body, I don\u2019t know\u2014only God knows.",
                "Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body.",
                "But I do know that I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell.",
                "That experience is worth boasting about, but I\u2019m not going to do it.",
                "I will boast only about my weaknesses.",
                "If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth.",
                "But I won\u2019t do it, because I don\u2019t want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message, even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God.",
                "So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.",
                "Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away.",
                "Each time he said, \u201cMy grace is all you need.",
                "My power works best in weakness.\u201d",
                "So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.",
                "That\u2019s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ.",
                "For when I am weak, then I am strong.",
                "You have made me act like a fool.",
                "You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these \u201csuper apostles,\u201d even though I am nothing at all.",
                "When I was with you, I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle.",
                "For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you.",
                "The only thing I failed to do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a financial burden to you.",
                "Please forgive me for this wrong!",
                "Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you.",
                "I don\u2019t want what you have\u2014I want you.",
                "After all, children don\u2019t provide for their parents.",
                "Rather, parents provide for their children.",
                "I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me.",
                "Some of you admit I was not a burden to you.",
                "But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery.",
                "But how?",
                "Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you?",
                "When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you?",
                "No!",
                "For we have the same spirit and walk in each other\u2019s steps, doing things the same way.",
                "Perhaps you think we\u2019re saying these things just to defend ourselves.",
                "No, we tell you this as Christ\u2019s servants, and with God as our witness.",
                "Everything we do, dear friends, is to strengthen you.",
                "For I am afraid that when I come I won\u2019t like what I find, and you won\u2019t like my response.",
                "I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly behavior.",
                "Yes, I am afraid that when I come again, God will humble me in your presence.",
                "And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins.",
                "You have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure. \n\n",
                "This is the third time I am coming to visit you (and as the Scriptures say, \u201cThe facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses\u201d).",
                "I have already warned those who had been sinning when I was there on my second visit.",
                "Now I again warn them and all others, just as I did before, that next time I will not spare them.",
                "I will give you all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me.",
                "Christ is not weak when he deals with you; he is powerful among you.",
                "Although he was crucified in weakness, he now lives by the power of God.",
                "We, too, are weak, just as Christ was, but when we deal with you we will be alive with him and will have God\u2019s power.",
                "Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine.",
                "Test yourselves.",
                "Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith.",
                "As you test yourselves, I hope you will recognize that we have not failed the test of apostolic authority.",
                "We pray to God that you will not do what is wrong by refusing our correction.",
                "I hope we won\u2019t need to demonstrate our authority when we arrive.",
                "Do the right thing before we come\u2014even if that makes it look like we have failed to demonstrate our authority.",
                "For we cannot oppose the truth, but must always stand for the truth.",
                "We are glad to seem weak if it helps show that you are actually strong.",
                "We pray that you will become mature.",
                "I am writing this to you before I come, hoping that I won\u2019t need to deal severely with you when I do come.",
                "For I want to use the authority the Lord has given me to strengthen you, not to tear you down.",
                "Dear brothers and sisters, I close my letter with these last words: Be joyful.",
                "Grow to maturity.",
                "Encourage each other.",
                "Live in harmony and peace.",
                "Then the God of love and peace will be with you.",
                "Greet each other with a sacred kiss.",
                "All of God\u2019s people here send you their greetings.",
                "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. \n\n"

        "1 Timothy": {
            "text": "This letter is from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, appointed by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus, who gives us hope. I am writing to Timothy, my true son in the faith. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace. When I left for Macedonia, I urged you to stay there in Ephesus and stop those whose teaching is contrary to the truth. Don\u2019t let them waste their time in endless discussion of myths and spiritual pedigrees. These things only lead to meaningless speculations, which don\u2019t help people live a life of faith in God. The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith. But some people have missed this whole point. They have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions. They want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses, but they don\u2019t know what they are talking about, even though they speak so confidently. We know that the law is good when used correctly. For the law was not intended for people who do what is right. It is for people who are lawless and rebellious, who are ungodly and sinful, who consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy, who kill their father or mother or commit other murders. The law is for people who are sexually immoral, or who practice homosexuality, or are slave traders, liars, promise breakers, or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome teaching that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God. I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength to do his work. He considered me trustworthy and appointed me to serve him, even though I used to blaspheme the name of Christ. In my insolence, I persecuted his people. But God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance and unbelief. Oh, how generous and gracious our Lord was! He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus. This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it: \u201cChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners\u201d\u2014and I am the worst of them all. But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life. All honor and glory to God forever and ever! He is the eternal King, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is God. Amen. Timothy, my son, here are my instructions for you, based on the prophetic words spoken about you earlier. May they help you fight well in the Lord\u2019s battles. Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked. Hymenaeus and Alexander are two examples. I threw them out and handed them over to Satan so they might learn not to blaspheme God. \n\nI urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. This is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth. For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity\u2014the man Christ Jesus. He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time. And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I\u2019m not exaggerating\u2014just telling the truth. In every place of worship, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy. And I want women to be modest in their appearance. They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes. For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do. Women should learn quietly and submissively. I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. Let them listen quietly. For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve. And it was not Adam who was deceived by Satan. The woman was deceived, and sin was the result. But women will be saved through childbearing, assuming they continue to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty. \n\nThis is a trustworthy saying: \u201cIf someone aspires to be a church leader, he desires an honorable position.\u201d So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife. He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach. He must not be a heavy drinker or be violent. He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money. He must manage his own family well, having children who respect and obey him. For if a man cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God\u2019s church? A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and the devil would cause him to fall. Also, people outside the church must speak well of him so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the devil\u2019s trap. In the same way, deacons must be well respected and have integrity. They must not be heavy drinkers or dishonest with money. They must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience. Before they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, then let them serve as deacons. In the same way, their wives must be respected and must not slander others. They must exercise self-control and be faithful in everything they do. A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his children and household well. Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus. I am writing these things to you now, even though I hope to be with you soon, so that if I am delayed, you will know how people must conduct themselves in the household of God. This is the church of the living God, which is the pillar and foundation of the truth. Without question, this is the great mystery of our faith: Christ was revealed in a human body and vindicated by the Spirit. He was seen by angels and announced to the nations. He was believed in throughout the world and taken to heaven in glory. \n\nNow the Holy Spirit tells us clearly that in the last times some will turn away from the true faith; they will follow deceptive spirits and teachings that come from demons. These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are dead. They will say it is wrong to be married and wrong to eat certain foods. But God created those foods to be eaten with thanks by faithful people who know the truth. Since everything God created is good, we should not reject any of it but receive it with thanks. For we know it is made acceptable by the word of God and prayer. If you explain these things to the brothers and sisters, Timothy, you will be a worthy servant of Christ Jesus, one who is nourished by the message of faith and the good teaching you have followed. Do not waste time arguing over godless ideas and old wives\u2019 tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly. \u201cPhysical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come.\u201d This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it. This is why we work hard and continue to struggle, for our hope is in the living God, who is the Savior of all people and particularly of all believers. Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them. Don\u2019t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity. Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them. Do not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecy spoken over you when the elders of the church laid their hands on you. Give your complete attention to these matters. Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress. Keep a close watch on how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what is right for the sake of your own salvation and the salvation of those who hear you. \n\nNever speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him respectfully as you would to your own father. Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers. Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters. Take care of any widow who has no one else to care for her. But if she has children or grandchildren, their first responsibility is to show godliness at home and repay their parents by taking care of them. This is something that pleases God. Now a true widow, a woman who is truly alone in this world, has placed her hope in God. She prays night and day, asking God for his help. But the widow who lives only for pleasure is spiritually dead even while she lives. Give these instructions to the church so that no one will be open to criticism. But those who won\u2019t care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers. A widow who is put on the list for support must be a woman who is at least sixty years old and was faithful to her husband. She must be well respected by everyone because of the good she has done. Has she brought up her children well? Has she been kind to strangers and served other believers humbly? Has she helped those who are in trouble? Has she always been ready to do good? The younger widows should not be on the list, because their physical desires will overpower their devotion to Christ and they will want to remarry. Then they would be guilty of breaking their previous pledge. And if they are on the list, they will learn to be lazy and will spend their time gossiping from house to house, meddling in other people\u2019s business and talking about things they shouldn\u2019t. So I advise these younger widows to marry again, have children, and take care of their own homes. Then the enemy will not be able to say anything against them. For I am afraid that some of them have already gone astray and now follow Satan. If a woman who is a believer has relatives who are widows, she must take care of them and not put the responsibility on the church. Then the church can care for the widows who are truly alone. Elders who do their work well should be respected and paid well, especially those who work hard at both preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, \u201cYou must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.\u201d And in another place, \u201cThose who work deserve their pay!\u201d Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses. Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others. I solemnly command you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus and the highest angels to obey these instructions without taking sides or showing favoritism to anyone. Never be in a hurry about appointing a church leader. Do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. Don\u2019t drink only water. You ought to drink a little wine for the sake of your stomach because you are sick so often. Remember, the sins of some people are obvious, leading them to certain judgment. But there are others whose sins will not be revealed until later. In the same way, the good deeds of some people are obvious. And the good deeds done in secret will someday come to light. \n\nAll slaves should show full respect for their masters so they will not bring shame on the name of God and his teaching. If the masters are believers, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. Those slaves should work all the harder because their efforts are helping other believers who are well loved. Teach these things, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. Some people may contradict our teaching, but these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life. Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding. Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words. This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy, division, slander, and evil suspicions. These people always cause trouble. Their minds are corrupt, and they have turned their backs on the truth. To them, a show of godliness is just a way to become wealthy. Yet true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth. After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can\u2019t take anything with us when we leave it. So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content. But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows. But you, Timothy, are a man of God; so run from all these evil things. Pursue righteousness and a godly life, along with faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness. Fight the good fight for the true faith. Hold tightly to the eternal life to which God has called you, which you have declared so well before many witnesses. And I charge you before God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, that you obey this command without wavering. Then no one can find fault with you from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. For, At just the right time Christ will be revealed from heaven by the blessed and only almighty God, the King of all kings and Lord of all lords. He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No human eye has ever seen him, nor ever will. All honor and power to him forever! Amen. Teach those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which is so unreliable. Their trust should be in God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment. Tell them to use their money to do good. They should be rich in good works and generous to those in need, always being ready to share with others. By doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may experience true life. Timothy, guard what God has entrusted to you. Avoid godless, foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge. Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness. May God\u2019s grace be with you all. \n\n",

        "2 Timothy": {
            "text": "This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. I have been sent out to tell others about the life he has promised through faith in Christ Jesus. I am writing to Timothy, my dear son. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace. Timothy, I thank God for you\u2014the God I serve with a clear conscience, just as my ancestors did. Night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. I long to see you again, for I remember your tears as we parted. And I will be filled with joy when we are together again. I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice. And I know that same faith continues strong in you. This is why I remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you. For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline. So never be ashamed to tell others about our Lord. And don\u2019t be ashamed of me, either, even though I\u2019m in prison for him. With the strength God gives you, be ready to suffer with me for the sake of the Good News. For God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did this, not because we deserved it, but because that was his plan from before the beginning of time\u2014to show us his grace through Christ Jesus. And now he has made all of this plain to us by the appearing of Christ Jesus, our Savior. He broke the power of death and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the Good News. And God chose me to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of this Good News. That is why I am suffering here in prison. But I am not ashamed of it, for I know the one in whom I trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until the day of his return. Hold on to the pattern of wholesome teaching you learned from me\u2014a pattern shaped by the faith and love that you have in Christ Jesus. Through the power of the Holy Spirit who lives within us, carefully guard the precious truth that has been entrusted to you. As you know, everyone from the province of Asia has deserted me\u2014even Phygelus and Hermogenes. May the Lord show special kindness to Onesiphorus and all his family because he often visited and encouraged me. He was never ashamed of me because I was in chains. When he came to Rome, he searched everywhere until he found me. May the Lord show him special kindness on the day of Christ\u2019s return. And you know very well how helpful he was in Ephesus. \n\nTimothy, my dear son, be strong through the grace that God gives you in Christ Jesus. You have heard me teach things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. Now teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others. Endure suffering along with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. Soldiers don\u2019t get tied up in the affairs of civilian life, for then they cannot please the officer who enlisted them. And athletes cannot win the prize unless they follow the rules. And hardworking farmers should be the first to enjoy the fruit of their labor. Think about what I am saying. The Lord will help you understand all these things. Always remember that Jesus Christ, a descendant of King David, was raised from the dead. This is the Good News I preach. And because I preach this Good News, I am suffering and have been chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained. So I am willing to endure anything if it will bring salvation and eternal glory in Christ Jesus to those God has chosen. This is a trustworthy saying: If we die with him, we will also live with him. If we endure hardship, we will reign with him. If we deny him, he will deny us. If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny who he is. Remind everyone about these things, and command them in God\u2019s presence to stop fighting over words. Such arguments are useless, and they can ruin those who hear them. Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth. Avoid worthless, foolish talk that only leads to more godless behavior. This kind of talk spreads like cancer, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus. They have left the path of truth, claiming that the resurrection of the dead has already occurred; in this way, they have turned some people away from the faith. But God\u2019s truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription: \u201cThe Lord knows those who are his,\u201d and \u201cAll who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil.\u201d In a wealthy home some utensils are made of gold and silver, and some are made of wood and clay. The expensive utensils are used for special occasions, and the cheap ones are for everyday use. If you keep yourself pure, you will be a special utensil for honorable use. Your life will be clean, and you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work. Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts. Again I say, don\u2019t get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights. A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people\u2019s hearts, and they will learn the truth. Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil\u2019s trap. For they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants. \n\nYou should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that! They are the kind who work their way into people\u2019s homes and win the confidence of vulnerable women who are burdened with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires. (Such women are forever following new teachings, but they are never able to understand the truth.) These teachers oppose the truth just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses. They have depraved minds and a counterfeit faith. But they won\u2019t get away with this for long. Someday everyone will recognize what fools they are, just as with Jannes and Jambres. But you, Timothy, certainly know what I teach, and how I live, and what my purpose in life is. You know my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance. You know how much persecution and suffering I have endured. You know all about how I was persecuted in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra\u2014but the Lord rescued me from all of it. Yes, and everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil people and impostors will flourish. They will deceive others and will themselves be deceived. But you must remain faithful to the things you have been taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you. You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work. \n\nI solemnly urge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who will someday judge the living and the dead when he comes to set up his Kingdom: Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favorable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching. For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear. They will reject the truth and chase after myths. But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don\u2019t be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the Good News, and fully carry out the ministry God has given you. As for me, my life has already been poured out as an offering to God. The time of my death is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful. And now the prize awaits me\u2014the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on the day of his return. And the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his appearing. Timothy, please come as soon as you can. Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you when you come, for he will be helpful to me in my ministry. I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. When you come, be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books, and especially my papers. Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm, but the Lord will judge him for what he has done. Be careful of him, for he fought against everything we said. The first time I was brought before the judge, no one came with me. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them. But the Lord stood with me and gave me strength so that I might preach the Good News in its entirety for all the Gentiles to hear. And he rescued me from certain death. Yes, and the Lord will deliver me from every evil attack and will bring me safely into his heavenly Kingdom. All glory to God forever and ever! Amen. Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and those living in the household of Onesiphorus. Erastus stayed at Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus. Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. May the Lord be with your spirit. And may his grace be with all of you. \n\n",
